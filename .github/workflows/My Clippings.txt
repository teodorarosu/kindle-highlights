Moving away from banal academic standards, art historians, and art critics, the transformation of art publishing—beginning with artist books and artist-led publishing ventures in the 1960s and 1970s—changed art practice and its media, but also fed back into cultural discourse and helped enable projects like Zone Books, which further intervened from a new hybrid perspective in the fields of aesthetics and art theory. Through these collective assemblages of enunciation, the conceptual terrain of art at the end of the twentieth century moved increasingly away from deconstruction and psychoanalysis toward an open field of naturecultures, infrastructure assemblages, and other newly contested territories.

At the apex of his insanity, Man has even proclaimed himself a “geological force,” going so far as to give the name of his species to a phase of the life of the planet: he’s taken to speaking of an “anthropocene.” For the last time, he assigns himself the main role, even if it’s to accuse himself of having trashed everything—the seas and the skies, the ground and what’s underground— even if it’s to confess his guilt for the unprecedented extinction of plant and animal species.82

characterizes the Anthropocene is that it is an era of intensity, and the worlds we are making through our art practices, science, and research are not made to measure. We made this book together because we wanted to think with these intensities with others. Illana Halperin makes this clear: we’ve been full of geology all along and we couldn’t have it any other way, even if we wanted to.106 What is different in the repetition of this crisis—the same crisis we’ve been hearing about since Walter Benjamin described its creeping, fascist pathos 107 —is that it appears to implicate all of us.108 The cunning of the Anthropocene as a sign is that it smuggles in a series of implications and assumptions about the anthropos and the kairos it names.109 While the many critical discussions regarding the sign have contested the patriarchal, colonial, and Eurocentric strands woven into this scientific nomenclature,110 McKenzie Wark has recently pointed out its achievement as a sign: “Rather than ‘interrogate’ Crutzen’s Anthropocene—and where did that metaphor come from?—perhaps it is 20 better to see it as what it is: a brilliant hack. The Anthropocene introduces the labor point of view—in the broadest possible sense—into geology. Perhaps the challenge is then to find analogous but different ways to hack other specialized domains of knowledge, to orient them to the situation and the tasks at hand.”111 Deleuze adds to the concept of the hack a critique of method: “There is no more a method for learning than there is a method for finding treasures, but a violent training, a paideia,

Separation is the spacing of existence, and is, by definition, never solitary but always shared. It is that which affirms that for anything to exist, there must be more than one thing, each one separated from each other one, together partaking in the spacing between that is opened up by separation. Existence, therefore, is relational and shared, and hence is always to be understood as coexistence. Not the coming together of solitary and autonomous beings, but existence as sharing or partaking in separation as the there is of existence—the spacing ( there) of being ( is) together. If separation is the spacing of existence, and if existence is always relational and shared, then sharing in separation is the praxis of coexistence—of being-together. 117 Being-together as a sharing in separation, as a praxis of coexistence, is necessarily and precisely beyond both measure and nomenclature.118 Such a measureless existence affords us a perspective—one decidedly less fatalistic than we are now so Art and Death | Heather Davis & Etienne Turpin 21 accustomed to—regarding intensities and aesthetics in the Anthropocene.

It has a couple of advantages. One is that you don’t have to say anything about science studies anymore. At the time of the Anthropocene, you don’t have to show again that science and politics are related, so that speeds things up. But to re-present this question at the time of the Anthropocene, nothing is simplified, because all the apparatuses of Man—Man dominating Nature—come back, except it takes a slightly dystopian version, which can be shifted a little bit and it becomes utopian again. Then we say: “Oh great, we’re so strong that we can re-make the planet”; we’ve become the engineers of the planet. I don’t think it’s a concept that’s going to last, but while it’s here we should use it because it is a connector, and it brings together artists, scientists, and philosophers.

Nevertheless, using the Anthropocene to simply restate one’s political commitments more emphatically, without addressing the pressing questions of population growth, technological interdependencies, and the contingent obligations of human settlement patterns, is an exercise in ideological futility; finding new approaches to posing problems is the work of both making art and making theory in the Anthropocene.21

Climatul în care s-a ivit creºtinismul se caracterizeazã printr-o tensiune dualistã între divinitate, care este transcendentã, ºi existenþa din lumea naturalã. De vreme ce adevãrata patrie a omului, limanul mîntuirii, este cerul, natura este socotitã un loc de exil, iar trupul  dupã maxima platonicã  un mormînt. Aceastã situaþie implicã, pe de o parte, o seducþie constantã exercitatã de naturã asupra omului, seducþie al cãrei efect este o alienare din ce în ce mai marcatã faþã de divinitate; pe de altã parte, ea implicã un efort constant  ale cãrui principale instrumente sînt religia însãºi ºi morala religioasã  de a scãpa capcanelor naturii. Natura este un organism lipsit de reflecþie, dotat cu frumuseþe ºi cu o enormã capacitate de fascinaþie, care genereazã fiinþele, le hrãneºte ºi le distruge. Dimpotrivã, religia reprezintã un ansamblu de reguli al cãror scop este sã-l fereascã pe om de distrugerea naturalã, asigurîndu-i indestructibilitatea pe plan spiritual.

La Heidelberg, prinţul palatin şi-a înconjurat soţia cu o continuare a lumii de vis pe care ea o cunoscuse la Londra. Chiar dacă producerea de piese pentru serbările curţilor sau construirea grotelor muzicale, a fîntînilor cîntătoare sau a statuilor vorbitoare întemeiate pe principii pneumatice pot să nu ne pară aplicaţii importante ale ştiinţei la tehnologie, totuşi, în fapt, pe asemenea căi ştiinţa Renaşterii, cufundată încă într-o atmosferă magică, a început să folosească abilităţi tehnice pe scară largă.

O tipăritură comemorativă publicată în ziua încoronării (fig. 8) îi în făţişează pe Frederic şi pe Elisabeta încoronaţi ca rege şi regină ai Boemiei. În fundal, refonnaţii şi pacea triumfă asupra contrarefonnei şi a războiului. Patru lei simbolizează alianţele pe care noul rege şi noua regină ai Boemiei puteau conta. Leul era animalul heraldic al lui Frederic personal, astfel că leul din stînga reprezintă leul Palatinatului, purtînd coroana Electorului. Urma apoi leul cu două cozi al Boemiei, leul britanic cu sabia lui şi leul Ţărilor de Jos. În partea de jos a tipăriturii aceste aluzii sînt explicate în versuri ger mane. Trebuiau cîntate pe o melodie de psalm şi, în traducere, încep astfel : 13 Sus inimile şi să ne lăsăm cuprinşi de bucurie, Mijesc razele trandafirii ale dimineţii. Iată, s-a ivit soarele Dumnezeu îşi Întoarce faţa către noi, Ne face cinstea de a ne da un rege Căruia vrăjmaşii nu-i pot sta împotrivă. Într-adevăr, din Numele Divin - scris în ebraică - cad raze de soare asupra lui Frederic şi a Elisabetei şi acestea sînt razele cele trandafirii ale unei noi dimineţi. Versurile pun un accent deosebit asupra modului în care aceşti zori depind de noua regină. Explicaţia stă în faptul că Wyc1if a venit din Anglia, Wyclif de la care Rus şi-a luat învăţătura - aluzie la influenţa lui Wyclif asupra reformei husite - iar acum o regină ne vine din Anglia.

Maier afmnă că Societatea Rozicruciană, precum şi scopurile ei pioase şi filantropice, se preocupă cu cercetarea naturii. P"rnă acum Natura nu s-a revelat decît pe jumătate ; ce mai lipseşte este în special experimentul şi cercetarea experimentală.38 Această sugestie a unei influenţe baconiene, poate o influenţă a însuşi Progresului ştiinţelor, este importantă.

Iată una dintre cele mai profunde ironii ale istoriei gîndirii : progresele ştiinţei mecanice, prin care s-a născut ideea mecanicismului ca o posibilă filozofie a naturii, erau ele însele un rezultat al tradiţiei magice a Renaşterii. Mecanicismul înstrăinat de magie a devenit filozofia care avea să elimine animismul Renaşterii şi să-I înlocuiască pe "vrăjitor" cu filozoful mecanicist.

Perspective is a hybrid of medieval theories of vision with the modern need to picture the world. It is often referred to as an early modern scientific way of representing vision that was then superceded both by Einstein's theory of relativity and by the demolition of pictorial space by the Cubist techniques of Pablo Picasso in the early twentieth century. Unfortunately, this neat paral el between scientific knowledge and visual representation does not hold up under closer analysis. Perspective was not one agreed system but a complex of representational strategies ranging from popular entertainments to geometric displays and means of social organization.

Imaginarul se amestecă în realitatea exterioară şi se confruntă cu ea; îşi găseşte acolo puncte de sprijin sau, dimpotrivă, un mediu ostil; poate fi confirmat sau repudiat. El acţionează asupra lumii şi lumea acţionează asupra lui. Dar, în esenţa sa, el constituie o realitate independentă, dispunînd de propriile sale structuri şi de propria sa dinamică.

Istoria imaginarului este o istorie structurală pentru că, pînă la urmă, chiar cele mai sofisticate dintre construcţiile spiritului pot fi simplificate, descompuse şi reduse la arhetip. Dar, de asemenea, şi o istorie foarte dinamică, tocmai pentru că arhetipurile sînt structuri deschise, care evoluează, se combină între ele şi al căror conţinut se adaptează continuu unui mediu social schimbător.

Explorarea globului la începutul epocii moderne ne oferă o ilustrare frapantă. Columb, descoperitorul Americii, a ignorat superb propria sa descoperire, pentru că aceasta nu corespundea imaginii acceptate a lumii (în care nu figura continentul american). O anumită geografie imaginară transmisă din Antichitate s-a dovedit mai puternică decît faptele geografice reale. Urmînd aceeaşi schemă moştenită, navigatorii au căutat în van, două sau trei secole, marele continent austral, care ar fi trebuit să acopere emisfera sudică a globului.

Din Evul Mediu, ştiinţa n-a făcut decît să urmărească "tranziţia unei societăţi centrate pe Dumnezeu spre o societate centrată pe comerţ, industrie şi căutare a profitului". Fiecărei societăţi îi corespunde un anumit proiect ştiinţific fundamental. "Ceea ce caracterizează ştiinţa noastră este dorinţa de a domina, de a exploata, de a manipula"; de aici decurge importanţa acordată cuantificării, legilor (în vederea unei "acţiuni eficace"), principiilor mecanice (o ştiinţă îndreptată spre acţiune, spre "inginerie").

distrugere-reconstruire a lumii operată de savanţi corespunde, cronologic, operaţiei similare desfăşurate de artişti şi scriitori împotriva formelor artistice şi literare tradiţionale. Căutarea nu era nici independentă, nici gratuită. Criza de la 1 900, marea cotitură prin care trecea în epocă civilizaţia occidentală s-au manifestat cu aceeaşi intensitate în ştiinţe, în litere şi în arte. Certitudinile unei Belle Epoque atît de satisfăcută de ea însăşi nu se mai potriveau spiritului vremii. Burghezia occidentală aspirase să unească lumea în jurul unui singur model, al său. Dar acest model era pe cale să se prăbuşească, şi cu el, în acelaşi timp, arta realistă a secolului al XIX-lea şi paradigmele ştiinţifice ale unei lumi sigure şi liniştitoare.30 Noile paradigme corespundeau unei sensibilităţi ,,relativiste" (teoria lui Einstein fiind, într-un fel, expresia ştiinţifică a unei stări de spirit), unei societăţi mai deschise şi mai diversificate. Ca şi revoluţia artistică, revoluţia ştiinţifică prefigura marea schimbare din secolul al XX-lea, căutarea, de fapt, a unui nou sistem de civilizaţie.

Este foarte semnificativ că această distrugere-reconstruire a lumii operată de savanţi corespunde, cronologic, operaţiei similare desfăşurate de artişti şi scriitori împotriva formelor artistice şi literare tradiţionale. Căutarea nu era nici independentă, nici gratuită. Criza de la 1 900, marea cotitură prin care trecea în epocă civilizaţia occidentală s-au manifestat cu aceeaşi intensitate în ştiinţe, în litere şi în arte. Certitudinile unei Belle Epoque atît de satisfăcută de ea însăşi nu se mai potriveau spiritului vremii. Burghezia occidentală aspirase să unească lumea în jurul unui singur model, al său. Dar acest model era pe cale să se prăbuşească, şi cu el, în acelaşi timp, arta realistă a secolului al XIX-lea şi paradigmele ştiinţifice ale unei lumi sigure şi liniştitoare.30 Noile paradigme corespundeau unei sensibilităţi ,,relativiste" (teoria lui Einstein fiind, într-un fel, expresia ştiinţifică a unei stări de spirit), unei societăţi mai deschise şi mai diversificate. Ca şi revoluţia artistică, revoluţia ştiinţifică prefigura marea schimbare din secolul al XX-lea, căutarea, de fapt, a unui nou sistem de civilizaţie.

Munca (în sensul său elementar) a fost o prezenţă obsedantă în interpretările "ştiinţifice" marxiste şi postmarxiste. Marx a explicat mecanismul exploatării capitaliste şi căderea inevitabilă a acestui sistem prin faimoasa teorie a valorii şi a plusvalorii, care reducea orice valoare la munca materializată a proletatului. Engels a făcut referinţă la muncă pentru a rezolva o problemă şi mai delicată: originea omului; prin muncă maimuţa s-a transformat, puţin cîte puţin, în fiinţă umană! Obsesia muncii fizice a marcat comunismul pînă în ultimele sale zile şi a contribuit din plin la blocarea cercetării şi la absenţa unei veritabile emulaţii intelectuale.

Să mai menţionăm şi întoarcerea în forţă a astrologiei, disciplină care, după epoca sa de glorie din timpul lui Nostradamus, a cunoscut o eclipsă determinată de raţionalismul triumfător din secolele al XVIII-lea şi al XIX-lea; astăzi, astrologia se adaptează demersului ştiin ţific ... sau paraştiinţific.

Beneficiind de un relativism pe care filozofia ştiinţelor nu-l mai poate repudia după ce 1-a promovat, paraştiinţele se bucură, de asemenea, şi de o imagine mai curînd favorabilă în opinia publică.

Paraştiinţele, New Age-ul şi realitatea virtuală nu fac decît să ,,reelaboreze" universul fermecat de odinioară. Ele sînt expresia actuală a unei rezistenţe durabile faţă de ideologiile dominante - teologia Evului Mediu, raţionalismul şi scientismul din epoca modernă -, care au încercat întotdeauna să "disciplineze" simultan organismul social şi corpusul cunoaşterii. Ele fac parte din aceeaşi dialectică ce opune şi reuneşte de multă vreme cultura savantă şi cultura populară (nici un zid etanş nu desparte, de altfel, cele două teritorii). Astăzi, zînele folclorice, transfigurate, intră în ştiinţele paralele, în timp ce ştiinţa oficială joacă rolul conservator şi liniştitor al unei adevărate teologii. Decorul nu mai este medieval, dar arhetipurile ignoră decorurile.

Difuzarea ştiinţei în toate direcţiile a fost asigurată, în primul rînd, prin vulgarizarea ştiinţifică, amorsată în Epoca Luminilor- arhetipul genului fiind cartea lui Fontenelle (1657-1757) Convorbiri despre pluralitatea lumilor, publicată în 1 686 şi retipărită de nenumărate ori -, dar instalată ferm în peisajul intelectual începînd de pe la 1 850. A doua jumătate a secolului al XIX-lea a devenit epoca de aur a vulgarizării35, care a beneficiat în egală măsură de impetuoasa dezvoltare a ştiinţelor, tehnicilor şi industriilor, de mitul progresului în plin avînt şi de un acces mai larg la învăţămînt şi cunoaştere ... Cărţi, reviste de specialitate, conferinţe, expoziţii, totul concura deja la o deschidere ştiinţifică fără precedent. Entuziasmul s-a mai domolit puţin după 1900, o dată cu declinul "religiozităţii" ştiinţifice proprii secolului trecut şi cu un anumit recul al ideii de progres.

O mişcare ce cîştigă teren de la începutul anilor 1 980 este New Age, fascicol de teorii şi practici diverse, reuni te însă prin aceeaşi dorinţă de evadare din cercul îngust al concepţiilor materialiste şi raţionaliste. New Age propovăduieşte o schimbare radicală de paradigmă care încorporează tot ceea ce ştiinţa oficială refuză sau marginalizează: factorul Psi, comunicarea cu alte entităţi (spirite sau extratereştri), terapii neconvenţionale . . . Ea proclamă, într-un sens pur milenarist, intrarea omenirii într-o eră care va marca triumful spiritului asupra materiei, transfigurarea omului şi emergenţa unei conştiinţe planetare.41 O posibilitate de evadare în afara lumii concrete este promisă şi de tehnicile realităţii virtuale. Simularea unui altfel de mediu progresează într-un asemenea ritm, încît mîine va fi greu să se mai distingă între universul real şi fantasmele ,,matFrializate". Aparenţa ştiinţifică a tuturor acestor tendinţe nu poate ascunde inserarea lor pe o durată foarte lungă.

Liniile principale au fost clar definite de Michel Hulin, care distinge patru axe de reprezentare: "amplasarea" lumii de apoi (proximitate sau îndepărtare); modalităţi de existenţă (pur spirituală sau reintegrare corporală); destin individualizat sau reîncarnări succesive; justi ţie (separînd damnaţii şi aleşii) sau iertare (reconciliere finală a tuturor). 1

Din acest moment, Occidentul a continuat să inoveze, în teologie, ca în toate celelalte domenii. Istoria europeană a cunoscut două viteze. Nu este vorba de a transforma viaţa de apoi în motor exclusiv; aceasta nu este decît un simptom printre altele. Un alt moment forte în istoria vieţii de apoi se anunţă în Europa occidentală la sfîrşitul Evului Mediu şi la începutul epocii moderne: din secolul al XIV-lea pînă în secolul al XVII-lea. O SCHEMĂ BIPOLARĂ : INFERN UL ŞI PARADISUL 1 07 Dezmembrarea structurilor feudale şi erupţia modernităţii deschid o criză structurală de amploare nu mai mică decît cea care a caracterizat ultimele secole ale Antichităţii. Teoriile şi mişcările milenariste au revenit în forţă după ce au cunoscut o oarecare eclipsă în timpul Evului Mediu. Sfirşitul lumii este din nou la ordinea zilei, potrivit celor două versiuni contradictorii sau complementare: dublul sfrrşit invocat de milenarişti sau sfirşitul definitiv şi Judecata de apoi.

Am regăsit în viaţa de apoi regulile care asigură funcţionarea mecanismului universal al imaginarului. Totul porneşte de la structurile arhetipale: intuiţia unei alte realităţi, viaţa de după moarte, jocul contrariilor. Pe această bază este construit modelul, fruct al istoriei: sfîrşitul lumii, Judecata de apoi, Infernul şi Paradisul, model prezentînd, la rîndul său, o remarcabilă fixitate structurală, adaptabilă unor contexte foarte diferite, ca Evul Mediu sau secolul al XIX-lea. În sfîrşit, inovaţiile, rezultînd din fiecare context istoric şi cultural, îmbogăţesc sau epurează tabloul, antrenînd, fără a pune în cauză esenţialul, deplasări de accent mai mult sau mai puţin semnificative. Fără a forţa prea mult interpretările, sîntem tentaţi să afirmăm că o puternică polarizare a vieţii de apoi indică un tip de societate conflictuală şi dinamică. Această dispoziţie întreţine, în egală măsură, o viziune universalistă şi individualistă a destinului uman. Ea se traduce şi printr-o sete de perfecţionare, susceptibilă să conducă la schimbare şi la progres. Pe de altă parte, împărţirea omenirii în "darnnaţi" şi "aleşi" dovedeşte un O SCHEMĂ BIPOLARĂ : INFERNUL ŞI PARADISUL 1 09 mare grad de intoleranţă faţă de "ceilalţi" - păgîni, necredincioşi, eretici - şi un fond de agresivitate. Spiritul de cucerire - cruciadă sau război sfint -, caracterizînd creştinismul şi islamismul, două mari religii axate pe o viaţă de apoi net polarizată, dovedeşte această mentalitate. În concluzie, afirmarea individului combinată cu un înalt grad de responsabilitate socială şi expansiune universală vizînd impunerea generală a propriilor valori au fost trăsăturile esenţiale ale istoriei Occidentului în timpului celui de-al doilea mileniu al erei noastre.

Vechiul sistem, feudal sau burghez, era clădit, în mod deschis, pe ameninţare şi pe represiune ("a supraveghea şi a pedepsi", pentru a relua cuvintele lui Michel Foucault). Societatea occidentală contemporană pare suficient de adultă pentru a practica un tip de constrîngere mai discret şi mai puţin brutal. Evoluţia efectivă a raporturilor sociale şi a moravurilor este amplificată şi mai mult prin discurs. Drepturile omului sînt mai adesea invocate decît datoriile sale. Lista păcatelor s-a restrîns considerabil, cel puţin în ochii opiniei publice, iar tendinţa este de a acuza mai curînd societatea, nedreptăţile şi rateurile sale decît păcătosul individual.

Nu e mai puţin adevărat că majoritatea contemporanilor noştri se simt puţin afectaţi de mesajul escatologic al religiei. Chiar dacă Paradisul este preferat Infernului, de fapt este afectată întreaga viaţă de apoi. Infernurile şi paradisurile terestre reale sau fictive (de la ră�boiul nuclear şi lagărele de exterminare la societatea de consum sau la "viitorul luminos") ari împins în planul al doilea figurile similare ale vieţii de apoi. Ioan-Paul la II-lea a descris perfect acest fenomen în cartea sa intitulată Să trecem pragul speranţei (1 994). Papa constată că teoiogii "nu mai au curajul să ameninţe cu Infernul". Şi, adaugă el, "este posibil ca chiar cei care-i ascultau să fi încetat să se teamă [ . ]. Trebuie să constatăm că contemporanii . . noştri au devenit aproape insensibili la ţelurile ultime".t4 Se poate deci astăzi să fii creştin fără să sacrifici prea mult vieţii de apoi; alte valori, nu mai puţin creştine, îi iau locul. . .

Într-o civilizaţie din ce în ce mai deschisă şi diferenţiată, arhetipul îşi păstrează substanţa, însă cîştigă în diversitate. Fărîmiţarea credinţelor corespunde fărîmiţării corpului social.

Pentru trib, ceea ce se găseşte în afara perimetrului său aparţine unei alte umanităţi, chiar nonumanului, dar în acelaşi timp - mulţumită sistemului totemic - fiinţele umane (şi chiar anumite animale) sînt invitate la un fel de fraternitate universală. 1 Societatea tehnologică n-a inventat nimic în acest domeniu: astăzi, ca şi ieri, se poate constata aceeaşi pendulare între grup şi specie, între valorizarea, chiar exacerbarea diferenţelor şi estomparea lor.

Istoria dovedeşte, totuşi, că alteritatea este mai influentă decît universalitatea. Ea pare mai susceptibilă să se lase invadată 1 1 8 PENTRU O ISTORIE A IMAGINARULUI şi chiar acoperită de imaginar. Trăsăturile particulare ale unei civilizaţii "exotice" ne fac să uităm uşor că moştenirea comună a raselor şi culturilor este mult mai importantă decît specificităţile acestora. Chiar între omul cavernelor şi omul erei tehnologice, diferenţele sînt, pînă la urmă, secundare faţă de asemănări. Ceea ce uneşte oamenii este mai important decît ceea ce îi separă. Variaţiile naturii umane contează puţin în comparaţie cu însăşi natura umană. Dar sîntem obligaţi să constatăm că diferenţele s-au impus mai bine spiritului decît similitudinile. "Tribalismul", naţionalismul, rasismul decurg dintr-o structură durabilă a imaginarului. Nu am putea să le raportăm exclusiv la anumite circumstanţe istorice, deşi istoria contribuie, desigur, la exacerbarea sau la aplanarea lor.

Istoria unei mari părţi a lumii a fost reconstituită cu ajutorul "surselor" fabricate aiurea, urmînd un discurs străin, inevitabil orientat, ideologizat şi deformat. Aceste surse necesită o nouă lectură, fie că este vorba de relatări de călătorie, de lucrări de istorie, de geografie sau de antropologie, de rapoarte politice sau diplomatice . . . Cine ar putea fi imunizat contra imaginarului? Chiar conceptul de "sursă" este în cauză. Cînd Herodot vorbeşte despre sciţi, discursul său nu se constituie în sursă a istoriei sciţilor, ci în sursă a ideologiei greceşti şi a imaginarului grecesc. Este discursul centrului despre periferie. Se pot eventual izola din acest discurs elemente "adevărate", se pot identifica, de asemenea, şi elemente pur fictive, toate reunite într-o sinteză coerentă prin forţa imaginarului şi urmîndu-i regulile.

Fiecare societate dispune de legiunile sale de minoritari şi de marginali, eretici, leproşi sau nebuni, suspecţi şi criminali. Mecanismul funcţionează neîntrerupt, dar cu manifestări diferite şi de intensitate variabilă, racordate la evoluţiile istorice. Astfel, marşul Occidentului spre modernitate s-a manifestat, timp de mai multe secole, printr-o netă tendinţă de excludere, prin obsesia de a înmulţi şi consolida zidurile şi îngrădirile. Demenţa şi infracţiunea au devenit concepte deosebit de elastice. Azilul de nebuni şi temniţa s-au erijat, după cum a arătat Michel Foucault, în adevărate simboluri ale lumii moderne ("epoca lor de aur" prelungindu-se din secolul al XVII-lea în secolul al XIX-lea)P Responsabili: consolidarea statului, ideologizarea raporturilor sociale, creşterea tensiunilor, reacţia de autoapărare a elitelor . . .

Dispreţuite şi reprimate pînă într-o perioadă recentă, minorităţile sexuale sînt treptat acceptate şi integrate. Există chiar o nouă distribuire a imaginarului vîrste lor. Pe vremuri prototipul era omul adult. Astăzi se poate constata mirajul exercitat de adolescenţă, ale cărei valori şi atitudini par a se impune chiar şi "vîrstei a treia". Este incontestabil faptul că societatea occidentală depune un efort de integrare remarcabil, în scopul de a reduce, chiar de a elimina conotaţiile devalorizante ale alterităţii. Anumite schimbări sînt spectaculoase. S-a trecut destul de brusc de la un rasism pur şi dur la negarea însăşi a conceptului de ,,rasă".21 Multă vreme dominante, valorile masculine trebuie să accepte afirmarea paralelă a valorilor feminine. Morala, religioasă sau sexuală, pe vremuri una şi indivizibilă, s-a sfărîmat în mai multe variante. Handicapaţii încep să fie consideraţi fiinţe umane în înţelesul deplin al termenului. Munca de informare destinată reducerii la proporţii juste a impactului sidei asupra imaginarului şi comportamentului social se înscrie în aceeaşi tendinţă de "aplanare".

Unificarea în creştere a organismului social şi a omenirii în general este înso ţită de un fenomen invers de "fragmentare". Niciodată lumea n-a fost aşa de unită, niciodată lumea n-a fost aşa de divizată ca astăzi. "CentJ:ele", în sensul cel mai tare al cuvîntului, îşi pierd din prestigiu şi din putere, în timp ce miri ade de "centre secundare" sînt pe punctul de a se constitui. Un fel de "nebuloasă" se instalează în locul a ceea ce semăna mai curînd cu un "sistem solar". Este Timpul triburilor, afirmă Michel Maffesoli într-o carte publicată în 1988. "În interiorul unei matrice definite se cristalizează o multitudine de poli de atracţie"; "un dute-vino constant se stabileşte între masificarea în creştere şi dezvoltarea microgrupurilor".22 Aceste cercuri de sociabilitate, în permanentă efervescenţă, sînt numite triburi de sociologul francez. Într-o societate "descentralizată" şi cu "geometrie variabilă", Celălalt va fi mai prezent şi mai diversificat, în func ţie de abundenţa "centrelor". Nu mai rămîne decît să sperăm că o astfel de evoluţie va sfirşi prin a banaliza fenomenul, "dedramatizînd" jocul clasic al alterităţilor.

Astfel, jocul alterităţilor este o structură permanentă a spiritului, care poate să se exerseze pe "ceilalţi" reali sau pur imaginari, urmînd o scală foarte extensibilă, mergînd de la deformarea infimă pînă la ficţiunea pură. Mecanismul funcţionează în strînsă corelaţie cu evoluţiile istorice şi manifestările ideologice. Nu este în nici un caz un joc gratuit. Este vorba de un mobil puternic care canalizează acţiunea oamenilor şi mersul istoriei. Totul trece, în cele din urmă, prin acest inepuizabil sistem de oglinzi.

Idealizarea insule lor cruţa te încă (dar pentru cîtă vreme?) şi a societăţii preistorice mergeau împreună, sprijinindu-se reciproc. Prin Vîrsta de aur, imaginarul îşi ducea marea sa bătălie împotriva lumii tehnologice în avînt. Civilizaţia tehnologică a cîştigat lupta, dar nici un triumf de ordin material nu poate să şteargă un arhetip. Poate însă să-I oblige să se adapteze.

Revoluţia milenaristă a atins apogeul în Germania, la începutul secolului al XVI-lea, o dată cu revolta "comunistă" a lui Thomas Miinzer (1 525), urmată de episodul Miinster (1 534-1 535), în care combatanţii Apocalipsului, conduşi de Jan van Leiden, au reuşit să se instaleze la putere; ei au abolit proprietatea privată, au ars toate cărţile, cu excepţia Bibliei, şi 1 56 PENTRU O I STORI E A IMAGI NARULU I au instituit poligamia (la fel ca patriarhii biblici).

În secolul al XX-lea, dimpotrivă, relativismul a cîştigat teren, eclipsînd scientismul. Astăzi nu se aşteaptă ca vreo ştiinţă să dea un răspuns incontestabil şi definitiv. Admiterea în clubul ştiinţelor pare mai puţin discriminatoare; în aparenţă, ar fi un motiv de satisfacţie pentru istorici. Adevărul este totuşi că, oricare ar fi gradul de exigenţă, istoria se găseşte, în orice situaţie, spre marginile spectrului ştiinţific.

Nostalgia trecutului este o constantă, şi idealizarea lui de asemenea, ceea ce explică invocarea vîrstei de aur şi regretul pentru "lumea pe care am pierdut-o". În variante mai mult sau mai puţin apropiate de arhetip, vîrsta de aur poate funcţiona şi funcţionează efectiv ca un mit politic. 1 De la începutul revoluţiei industriale, rolul său a fost să combată distrugerea structurilor tradiţionale şi a echilibrelor naturale şi, chiar dacă nu să anihileze, cel puţin să frîneze frenezia tehnologică. De la "rousseauismul" Luminilor la ecologismul contemporan s-a afirmat un puternic curent de sensibilitate, denunţînd progresul cu orice preţ, în numele - explicit sau implicit - al purităţii originilor. Atitudine în acelaşi timp revoluţionară, deoarece se opune sistemului existent şi tendinţelor dominante, şi conservatoare, chiar reacţionară, deoarece încearcă să actualizeze un model depăşit de istorie. Această condiţie echivocă petmite vîrstei de aur să se manifeste la fel de bine la stînga, cît şi la 1 90 PENTRU O I STORIE A IMAGI NARUL U I dreapta. Astăzi, ecologia este de stînga; a existat, de asemenea, un anumit socialism tentat de mirajul lumii preindustriale.

Vîrsta de aur nu este decît un caz particular al recursului global la istorie, la toate modelele, reale sau fictive, sau reale şi fictive în acelaşi timp, pe care istoria pare susceptibilă să le propună prezentului.

Un copil-erou poate pieri, însă el nu va fi niciodată trădat de victorie; ziua de mîine îi aparţine, cauza sa trebuie să triumfe, pentru că el încarnează tinereţea lumii. 5 Acest tip anume de erou apare mai ales în cursul confruntărilor ideologizate la maxim şi orientate spre viitor, spre un viitor "purificat"; Bara şi Viala în timpul Revoluţiei franceze; Gavroche, cel mai "real" dintre toţi, pentru că este complet imaginar; o lungă serie eroică în timpul primului război mondial (mai ales în tabăra franceză, gaj preţios al victoriei); în sfîrşit, un veritabil tînăr panteon sovietic celebrînd eroismul "comsomoliştilor" pe frontul muncii, ca şi în război (Tînăra gardă, 1 945, de Aleksandr Fadeev, urma să marcheze una sau două generaţii de adolescenţi).

The vanishing point that organized perspective had now become a point of social control. The guards could thus see the prisoners without being seen themselves. Rather than control prisoners with expensive fortifications and numerous guards as was traditionally the case, they could now be managed from one central point. As Foucault put it, in the panopticon "visibility is a trap" (Foucault 1977:200). The panopticon sought to control prisoners and keep discipline through a system of visibility: "And, in order to be exercised this power had to be given the instrument of permanent, exhaustive, omnipresent surveillance, capable of making all visible as long as it could itself remain invisible. It had to be a faceless gaze that transformed the whole social body into a field of perception" (Foucault 1977:214). The disciplinary society was not a necessary consequence of the perspectival system, any more than perspective was a creation -50- of scientific discoveries in optics. Both visual systems simply adapted materials that came to hand in creating new mode of visualizing the world.

Contemporaries saw that the perspective effect was the primary emotional goal of the painting, as this comment from a perspective handbook attests: "Throughout his extraordinary performances, the magic of linear and aerial perspective is substituted for that great level of our sympathies, the portrayal of passion and sentiment….

De Piles emphasized the role of the spectator in creating the effects of a work of art, especially as regards the sublime. The picture had to attract the attention of the spectator by causing her or him to feel enthusiasm for the work. In turn the spectator had to analyze the image in order to find the sublime, the highest goal in art: "In short, it seems to me that enthusiasm seizes us and we seize the sublime" (de Piles 1708:117). In order for this -52- interaction to work, a mutual process of recognition was required. By responding to the artificiality of the picture, the spectator attested to her or his cultured status, as well as naming the object looked at as a work of art. Attaining the sense of the sublime was a second higher stage within culture. As the distinguishing mark of painting, color was central both to attracting the spectator and to creating the sublime. There is an ambiguity here as to whether the spectator or the picture is, as it were, responsible for reaching this higher level. If it is a measure of the work, then a failure to experience the sublime is simply a failure of artistic attainment. On the other hand, if the viewer was responsible, it implied that he or she was insufficiently cultivated to appreciate the artwork, accounting in part for the rise of published art criticism in the eighteenth century so that gallery visitors could appear suitably informed. De Piles' seemingly open-ended aesthetic system in fact implied the appearance of a new form of social distinction between those who did and did not "appreciate" art, a worry that continues to haunt spectators to the present day. No effective system could be devised for standardizing the construction of picture space by color.

The formal quality of the application of color thus involved a complex interaction of race, gender and colonial politics. This range of allusions was perhaps too suggestive. Later nineteenth-century artists sought to control color by again subjecting it to racial theory -56- and ultimately by concentrating solely on light. Through this focus on light, the Impressionists and later modern artists have sought to control reality itself. The pro-Impressionist critic Edmond Duranty asserted that light in itself "reflects both the ensemble of all the [color] rays and the color of the vault that covers the earth. Now, for the first time, painters have understood and reproduced, or tried to reproduce these phenomena" (Broude 1991:126).

Even today, artistic photography is far more likely to be in black-and-white than color even though everyday photography is almost exclusively in color. In this view, the intrusion of color into the photographic image disrupted its claim to be accurate by distracting the eye. Its mechanical exactitude nonetheless prohibited its being considered art. The impossibility of classifying colored photography shows that the formal rules that had governed the visual image since the early modern period no longer held good. Resem- -62- blance now belonged to the camera, not to perspective or color. Visual culture had entered the age of photography.

The gap between the wealth of visual experience in postmodern culture and the ability to analyze that observation marks both the opportunity and the need for visual culture as a field of study. While the different visual media have usually been studied independently, there is now a need to interpret the postmodern globalization of the visual as everyday life. Critics in disciplines ranging as widely as art history, film, media studies and sociology have begun to describe this emerging field as visual culture.

With its low cost and availability, photography democratized the visual image and created a new relationship to past space and time. For the first time, it was possible for the ordinary person to record his or her life with certainty and to create personal archives for future generations. With the rise of computer imaging and the creation of digital means to manipulate the photograph, we can in turn say that photography is dead. Of course photography will continue to be used every day in vast quantities but its claim to mirror reality can no longer be upheld. The claim of photography to represent the real has gone.

Time became modern in three central aspects. First, the development of railways and other mass communications led to the adoption of standardized time zones and national time. As a result, all clocks in England were calibrated to the same time whereas they had previously respected the actual variation of time created by geography so that a clock in London would be a few minutes ahead of one in Bristol. Second, the destruction of the old world and its replacement by a new, modern society was one of the most commented upon features of the nineteenth century. The classic example was the rebuilding of Paris in the 1850s and 1860s by Baron Haussmann, who drove broad new boulevards through the narrow maze of early modern streets in the center of the city. In so doing, he at once destroyed many working-class districts of the city, provided the means to move troops into Paris in the event of an insurrection and created the cityscape that was to be celebrated by the Impressionists. Finally, the West saw itself as modern in relation to its colonies in Africa, Asia, and Australasia. Europeans presumed that the -69- indigenous peoples they encountered were "living fossils," to use Charles Darwin's phrase, examples of what was now the past in Europe, preserved by accident for their study. For nineteenth-century Europeans, time moved in a straight line, parallel to progress, and both were moving at everincreasing speed.

The most striking example of this new vision was the rendering of movement by Etienne-Jules Marey and Eadward Muybridge. At roughly the same time in Paris and California, the two scientists devised methods of capturing the different segments of movement that the human eye could not register. To satisfy a bet for his patron Leland Stanford, Muybridge famously proved that a horse's feet do not point forwards and backwards in a gallop as artists had always depicted them. In an instant, Muybridge demonstrated that centuries of equine painting were completely inaccurate.

Capturing movement was, of course, the prime achievement of cinema and the prosthetic eye became reconfigured as the movie camera. The early Soviet director Dziga Vertov so identified with this process that he claimed: "I am the cinema-eye. I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, can show you the world as only I can see it" (Burgin 1996:43). Visuality was now photographic.

The history of photography can never be fully written because, as soon as the medium was invented, countless images were created and continue to be created. In 1991, 41 million photographs were taken every day in the United States alone. Even though the apparatus itself was expensive at first, obtaining images was not. Just as the era of computer imaging and virtual reality already seems to offer far more than the technology can actually now deliver, so too did photography's possibilities at once become apparent to the mass audience. However, unlike computer imaging, photography was democratic from its first appearance. For the first time in history, the broad mass of the people had access to a means of recording their appearance for posterity. In a very real sense, time past became available as a mass -71- commodity.

Lacan argued that each photograph could be precisely correlated on a map of Paris by price and location: "One can establish this mathematical proportion: a photographer of such and such a street is to a photographer of such and such a boulevard as 2 francs is to 55." In so doing, Lacan sought to defuse the democratic potential of the photograph by arguing that the type of photograph one purchased inevitably revealed your social class. Quality of photography thus mirrored social quality, to use the nineteenth-century term, that was again perfectly reflected by price. He even sub-divided photographers into four classes, corresponding to social class: the basic photographer (working class or artisan); the artist-photographer (bourgeois); the amateur, in the sense of connoisseur, hence aristocrat; and the distinguished photographer-savant, who claimed the classless status of the artist. Thus those who saw themselves as the photographic élite argued that "legitimate photography" was that which could be identified as belonging to a specific place, time and class. It is hardly surprising that Lacan's belief that social class could be precisely calibrated from a photograph using the twin axes of cost and location was -72- not always accurate in practice

in a time of dramatic social change, photography seemed to offer a chance to make class positions transparent, both for photographer and client, even if only for the instant in which the picture was taken. In this sense, photography did not reflect class, it was class. This attempt to give photography what Rosalind Krauss has called "singularity" cut across what was to be its most revolutionary feature, namely mass reproducibility. In his famous essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin argued that the reproducibility of photography undercut the aura of art. For while a painting is unique, many identical prints can be made from one negative.

Today it is still the case that if a photograph can claim serious artistic merit, then it legally cannot be obscene. This artistic distinction rests firmly on the class distinctions made by photography's early champions, which have been accepted for so long that they now seem "natural."

What the object photographed is to be called and what judgement we make of that is up to the viewer, but the fact that something was present to be photographed cannot be denied. As a result, photography is a past-tense medium. It says "that was there" not what is there. It emphasizes the distance between the viewer of the photograph and the time in which the photograph was taken. In a secular society the photograph is Death's point of entry into everyday life, or as Barthes puts it: "With the Photograph, we enter into flat death"

In her portrait of Ivy with Marilyn, Boston (1973), Goldin captures one of her friends from the cross-dressing scene at the Boston night club The Other Side, dressed and ready to go out (see Figure 2.5). Ivy strikes a glamourous pose beneath a reproduction of Andy Warhol's silk-screened portrait of Marilyn Monroe. In this photograph, the notion of femininity as masquerade and performance that have recently become current in feminist theory (Butler 1990) were pictured and given personal form by the 20-year old Nan Goldin. Goldin saw transvestites, bisexuals and others prepared to experiment with gender roles as a "third gender," a vanguard group pushing forward the frontiers of identity.

Photography came into being at a time of profound social change in attitudes to the dead and to death. It thus participated in a new means of configuring death at the same time as it offered an everyday reminder of death. The experience of mass industrial society led to a desacralization of death and its experience from a public religious ceremony in the early modern period into the private, medicalized case history of modernity. By the 1860s even the Goncourt brothers, conservative French art critics, observed that "as societies advance or believe themselves to advance, to the degree that there is civilization and progress, so the cult of the dead, the respect for the dead, diminishes.

Death took place in the home, rather than the hospital, and was often a public spectacle, attended by friends and family. With very high infant mortality rates and low life expectancy, no family was unfamiliar with loss. In place of the wax death mask or death bed engraving, photography came to be the prime means of capturing the image of the departed. Due to its lower cost, it opened remembrance to a wider strand of society than ever before and it became common to see photographs displayed on headstones. In this way, death became not just a metaphorical means of understanding the power of photography, but one of its privileged subjects. The celebrated early French photographer Nadar claimed a coup in 1861 with his photographs of the Paris catacombs. By devising a means of artificial lighting, he showed something that could not previously be reproduced while at the same time claiming the kingdom of the dead for photography.

Modern concerns about environmental changes at a global scale, such as climatic change, tropical deforestation, desertifica-tion and sea-level rise, are all bound up with landscape. Change, rather than stability, may be the normal state for landscapes, at many different spatial scales and speeds.18 Rates of landscape change have accelerated over time with the advances in technology, the growing complexity of society and increases in population. The extent and rate of landscape change can be measured in some circumstances – for example, seventeenth-century Dutch reclamation or Parliamentary enclosure in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century England – but it is much harder to measure small-scale, frequent changes operating over long timescales than the occasional ‘revolutions’.19

In medieval times, the word ‘landscape’ referred to an area owned by a lord or inhabited by a particular group of people. The modern use of the term goes back to the sixteenth century, when Italian and Dutch painters began to use it to indicate a representation of scenery. The term ‘landscape’ embraces a bewildering diversity of definitions.21 It is often used imprecisely and ambiguously, with multiple layers of meaning. Landscape has been seen as a useful concept, because it is free from fixed positions, elusive in meaning yet all-embracing in scope.22 It is frequently seen as an integration of natural and human phenom-ena, which can be studied objectively and empirically, classified, analyzed and mapped. While scenery is considered to be something to which everyone can react aesthetically, landscape is something to be examined with a trained eye. We also need to penetrate below superficial levels of meaning and interpretation, however, to understand deeper meanings, through studying the iconography of landscape, a term derived from art history.23

More recently, within archaeology, the growing awareness of the limitations of site-oriented studies has generated a wider interest in field survey to provide information about human activities in wider contexts, and this has given rise to the sub-discipline of landscape archaeology. In this approach, archaeological landscapes exist as past surfaces within a defined timespan, which are influenced by antecedent features and later modifications. A past landscape surface can be buried, eroded or changed by human and environmental processes. Landscape surfaces produced by the cultural and physical processes of one period influence the activities of later inhabitants, so that landscapes are not simply passive creations of human activities, but dynamic, interactive elements in the development of societies. This requires us to consider what the antecedent and subsequent character of a landscape has been in order to understand it at any particular period.27

In recent years, landscape has been seen in less concrete, visible terms and more subjectively.45 An alternative set of approaches to landscape emphasizes its symbolic qualities, rather than focusing on the physical and structural aspects of landscapes as artefacts.46 Landscape, in this view, is the external world mediated through subjective human experience. Landscape is not merely the world we see; it is a construction of that world. Landscape is thus a social and cultural product, a way of seeing projected on to the land, with its own techniques and composi-tional forms, a restrictive gaze that diminishes other modes of experiencing our relations with nature. Landscapes are not l a n d s c a p e a n d h i s t o ry . 1 7 merely ‘there’ on the ground, but are socially constructed within a complex set of linkages among variables, such as race, class and gender. Landscapes are culturally determined, not just because they are the products of human decisions, but because they are understood through sets of perceptions that are themselves culturally and historically conditioned.47 Such approaches are concerned with how landscapes are perceived, interpreted and represented.

The development of a new relationship between humans and the environment at the time of the Renaissance was associated with the establishment of linear perspective, sophisticated map projections, landscape painting and the construction of rational human landscapes. Landscape is thus intimately linked with a new way of seeing the world as a rationally ordered, designed and harmonious creation, the structure and mechanism of which are accessible to the human mind and eye. The idea of landscape developed in a context of new ways of representation, such as linear perspective and improved techniques of surveying and cartography. This landscape idea has then a defi-nite history stretching from the Renaissance to modern times.

In painting and garden design, landscape achieved visually and ideologically what surveying and map-making achieved practically: the control and domination of space and its transformation into the property of the individual or the state. More recent work on landscapes has been concerned with their role in creating national identity, and on landscapes in the context of colonialism and post-colonialism. In creating overseas colonial empires, European nations, especially Britain and France, interpreted the landscapes that they found in terms of European landscape aesthetics.

Maps and landscape art shade into each other through high vantage points and bird’s-eye views to a truly vertical perspective. Maps, like any other document, are socially constructed forms of knowledge, which reflect the societies that produced them and their values, as much as the landscapes that they portray. Their codes are 24 . l a n d s c a p e a n d h i s t o ry historically specific; they are not in themselves either true or false. In the selectivity of their content, they are social products that highlight the concerns of their cartographers and the patrons who commissioned them. Maps have provided ways in which power could be gained, administered and legitimized. Map-making has usually been associated with elites; with internal administration linked to the growth of nation states, with defence or with territorial expansion. Maps have supported the exercise of power at a range of scales from the individual estate to global empires. Like cannon and warships, they were weapons of imperialism, sometimes anticipating expansion and empire building by making advance claims to territory. Equally, once lands had been accessed, they helped to create the myths that held nations and empires together. At one scale, the history of the map was closely linked to that of the nation state, since the state was a major patron of cartographic activity. At another scale, cadastral or estate maps were linked to the rise of agrarian capitalism, providing control and organization through information on ownership, tenancy and rents.70 Maps, then, are purposive interpretations of, and commentaries on, the human and physical world and the landscapes resulting from their interaction.71 What is distinctive about them is not their distance from reality, but the fact that they are systematic. They are descriptive, not only of the world they seek to portray, but also of the system that produced them. Maps also represent technology, and technology has often been used as a rationale for conquest and dominance. Contrasts in cartographic approaches over time can be demonstrated at a macro scale by the difference in world views between the medieval Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral and the nineteenth-century Mercator projection of the world, which highlighted the British Empire in red, one reflecting the place of the world in divine creation, the other the place of Britain in world domination.72

The landscapes of early-sixteenth-century Europe mostly developed under the impact of feudalism, underlain by the legacies of prehistoric, early-historic and Roman times. A good deal of landscape change occurred under feudalism in medieval and post-medieval times, rather than during the period of the Great Migrations at the end of the Roman Empire. Feudalism was a form of social organization that was based on land as the primary means of production. Land was held and worked communally by peasants, who rendered labour and produce to their feudal lords in return for protection. Feudal lords maintained themselves through the institution of the manor, the means by which feudalism was articulated in the landscape. Within feudalism, land was held principally for its use rather than its exchange value.

People were closely linked with, and dependent upon, their local environment, because of the difficulty of transporting bulk food-stuffs from areas of surplus to those of deficit. The medieval manor, and the feudal system that underpinned it, has been seen as a stable, sustainable system, in which many of the resources, representing different components of the landscape, were held and worked in common by communities in a balanced, equitable form of resource management, which helped to reduce the risk of shortages and starvation.1

There was, however, no single ‘feudal landscape’, just as there was no single, monolithic feudal system: feudalism and its landscapes varied nationally and regionally, as well as changing over time. The build-up of population throughout Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries demonstrated that the feudal system could become strained. Population growth led to the creation of new settlements, and the taking into cultivation of increasingly marginal land, the clearance of woodland and the drainage of wetlands.

In 1500 European landscapes were still essentially feudal, and the pace of landscape change was slow. Early modern Europe, from the Mediterranean to the fringes of the Arctic, was characterized by a great variety of cultural landscapes, the patterns of which reflected geology, climate, vegetation, soils and topography, as well as political, economic and social influences.

French geographers, notably Vidal de la Blache, identified a complex mosaic of landscape units, or pays, within France. Within each pays, the physical environment, the farming systems, settlement patterns, vernacular building traditions and cultural traits were closely inter-related to form landscape units that were clearly 28 . l a n d s c a p e a n d h i s t o ry distinguishable by local inhabitants, as well as by academics.

Within a single province, such as Champagne, there might be more than 30 individual pays, some recognized only locally, some defunct by modern times, but all once recognizable visually.4 The distinctive identities of such pays often went back many centuries, and, if more blurred than formerly, are often still evident today. While such regions have been studied in more detail in France, they existed widely throughout pre-industrial Europe. In England, where patterns of pays have been obscured by early industrialization and urbanization, patterns of ‘farming regions’, similar in many respects to pays, have been identified by economic historians. While these evolved over time and sometimes changed their character quite markedly as a result of agrarian improvement, they were probably at their most distinctive in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.5

In the areas of planned countryside, prehistoric and Roman landscapes were swept away and replaced by open field systems and nucleated settlements. In England, this zone of planned countryside was then replanned in an even more systematic way during the era of Parliamentary enclosure in the later eighteenth e a r ly m o d e r n l a n d s c a p e s 29 and early nineteenth centuries.9 The origins of non-planned landscape zones could be complex, and have been disputed. Tom Williamson has claimed that the automatic identification of wood pasture areas with late settlement is misleading, and that some of the woodland areas were as densely populated at the time of Domesday Book as open field areas.10 Neither were champion areas necessarily distinguished by unity of lordship.

In mountain and upland areas, where there was plenty of rough pasture, systems of transhumance were widespread, where the high summer grazings were exploited using temporary settlements – saeters in Norway, e a r ly m o d e r n l a n d s c a p e s . 3 1 The remnants of a nineteenth-century shieling hut in central Lewis in the Outer Hebrides; the last phase of a long tradition. shielings in Scotland, booleys in Ireland. Transhumance declined only with the penetration of more commercialized systems of livestock farming at various dates from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries.17 At a smaller scale, the complex relationships between environment and socio-economic and social structures produced a wide range of traditional building styles, which formed an integral part of the landscape. Because of the difficulty and expense involved in transporting building materials any distance other than for prestige, high-status projects, most houses below those of the gentry were built using local materials, in styles and with layouts that reflected the nature of the local environment and the needs of the local economy. The contrast between the vernacular buildings of the ordinary people and the polite architecture of the more well-to-do could sometimes be relatively muted, since similar materials and layouts might be used, as in the timber-frame tradition of southern England and the North European Plain, or it could be very marked, as on a map of Carrickfergus drawn around 1560, on which the round, windowless turf cabins of the native Irish stand out sharply from the stone houses of merchants and craftsmen in the more prosperous town centre.18 32 . l a n d s c a p e a n d h i s t o ry Contrasts also existed between the log construction used in areas with plentiful timber, such as eastern Europe and Muscovy, and those with less timber but little good building stone, as in the timber-frame housing tradition of the North European Plain. In clay lowlands with no timber, walls of solid-clay construction were common, while areas with stone but little timber, such as upland Britain, used both mortared and dry-stone walling. There were differences between the layouts of farmsteads in arable and pastoral areas; in the former, there was a greater need for outbuildings that provided storage for grain, tools, plough teams and carts. Layouts of farm buildings around courtyards were characteristic of larger farms in some arable areas, such as the Paris Basin.19 Long houses, with people and cattle accommodated under the same roof, were once thought to have been characteristic mainly of the poorer pastoral areas of northern and western Europe,20 but the excavation of deserted villages in lowland England has shown that they were replaced with better-quality accommodation in late medieval times.21

This emphazises how increasing prosperity could alter housing traditions. The Great Rebuilding of southern and central England in Tudor times led to the conversion or replacement of traditional houses over a wide area within certain social classes, as did a similar trend in northern England a century or so later.22

The transition from feudalism to capitalism involved many complex, inter-connected elements, but all were related to a major shift in the ways in which European societies used their environments and how this was reflected in the landscape. The self-contained world of the manor became integrated into the e a r ly m o d e r n l a n d s c a p e s . 3 3 space-economy of the region and then the nation state, becoming commercially oriented and specialized in the process. By the thirteenth century, the revival of trade and the growth of towns were encouraging the increasing commercialization of agriculture close to the larger urban centres in areas such as Flanders. The massive mortality of the fourteenth century caused by famines, notably in 1315–17, the Black Death in 1348–9 and later outbreaks of bubonic plague, reduced population by a third or more in Europe, cutting back to approximately the levels of around 1200. This drastically altered the balance between population and resources, and helped to weaken feudalism. In England, the population fell from around 6 million in 1300 to about 1.5 million in 1450.23

Population decline on this scale inevitably affected the landscape. The actual processes at work are not very clear, because documentation is limited. Abandonment of settlement and regeneration of woodlands did occur,24 although in many parts of France, for example, temporary abandonment was much more common than permanent desertion, even during periods of instability such as the Hundred Years War (1337–1453) and the Thirty Years War (1614–48).

After the Black Death, in order to attract and retain tenants, landlords had to rent out demesnes and reduce feudal restrictions. The renting of land in itself promoted a cash economy, which further encouraged social change with the emergence of rentier landlords, groups of wealthier peasants and increasing numbers of landless labourers.

A shift from intensive arable farming with ample peasant labour to less intensive crop production or extensive livestock farming occurred in areas such as the English Midlands and the Paris Basin. In Alsace, many smaller settlements were deserted as the population became concentrated into larger villages.26 In the landscape this was shown by the extensive abandonment of cultivation in favour of pasture, and the retreat of rural settlement from marginal areas, as in the Cheviots and Dartmoor in England.

Remnants of feudalism often survived when the dominant mode of production had shifted decisively towards capitalism, such as the continuation of thirlage to estate mills in late eighteenth-century Scotland. On the other hand, the reverse occurred in eastern Europe, east of the Elbe, in a huge territory that had been won from the Slavs and colonized in medieval times. In this zone, which had been characterized by freer tenures than in western areas, a ‘second feudalism’ was later imposed, as lords built up estates and extended their powers over their peasantry. A focus on demesne cultivation and the production of large grain surpluses for western European markets provided the context in which, through a manorial structure in some areas and a system resembling plantations in others, a once-free peasantry became enslaved. The process was under way by 1300 and was nearly complete by the later sixteenth century, by which time demesne cultivation had largely disappeared from western Europe, with the commutation of labour services into money payments. In the process of expanding demesnes in countries such as Poland, peasants were often dispossessed and relocated in new, planned street villages.27

The population of France, Germany and England had stood at c. 22 million in 1200 and c. 40 million in 1340, but had dropped to c. 27 million by 1470 only to rise to c. 42 million by 1620.39 Population growth and increasing commercialization, associated with the stimulus of urban markets, began to affect the European landscape, although agricultural progress and its associated landscape changes were mainly a feature of only a few areas: northern Italy, southern France, the Low Countries and parts of eastern England. In these regions, agricultural output was increased by more sophisticated rotations, the introduction of new crops, improved techniques of cultivation, and also by the reclamation of new land. In the Low Countries, the elimination of fallowing and the incorporation into rotations of fodder crops such as turnips, lucerne and sown grasses, and the growing of industrial crops such as flax, hemp, madder and woad, were also features. The wide range of fertilizers used also encouraged the intensification of animal husbandry.40 In particular, the changing relationship between society and environment in post-medieval times was reflected in the landscape by enclosure, the reclamation of land from marshes and the sea, and the clearance of woodland and heath.

In England, in the southern Pennines and parts of Cumbria, the improvement of small areas of waste by land-38 . l a n d s c a p e a n d h i s t o ry hungry squatters produced a system of smallholding agriculture that was combined with domestic textile manufacture. This created a densely-settled, busy landscape that is still distinctive today. Enclosure of this sort was often allowed by manorial lords in situations where pasture was plentiful, the squatters eventually being formally entered in the manorial court rolls.41

Enclosure was thus relatively well documented. It was encouraged by economic conditions, especially the shift of prices in favour of wool and against cereals. In parts of the Midlands and eastern England, communities of mixed-farming smallholders were evicted, and their farms were amalgamated and enlarged into big commercial sheep runs. Many of the communities involved had already suffered population decline, but the density of deserted villages from this period in some areas helps to explain the concern of Tudor governments.43 In fact, the scale of the problem was exaggerated, for recent research suggests that enclosure in England between 1450 and 1599 accounted for only about 3 per cent of the total enclosed land, compared with nearly 25 per cent between 1600 and 1699. The seventeenth century was a period of more widespread, but less obtrusive, enclosure from both open fields and waste, often by private agreement between small groups of landowners, in which a substantially greater area was probably enclosed than in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth centuries.44

Some drainage of shallow lakes had been achieved in the sixteenth century, but from the early seventeenth century the development of improved windmills, able to lift water more than 3 m (9 ft), encouraged a considerable expansion of this type of reclamation. The first major project was the drainage of the Beemster lake, covering some 6,912 ha (27 sq miles) and about 4 m (12 ft) deep. Amsterdam merchants provided the capital, the Dutch engineer, Jan Leeghwater, the expertise. Within five years, with the use of more than 40 windmills, some 7,000 ha (17,500 a) of land had been reclaimed and 207 new farms established. The technique involved surrounding a lake by a dyke and pumping water out into a drainage canal, which was connected, via sluices, to a river or the sea. Progress continued until the late seventeenth century, when the amounts of both types of reclamation fell abruptly.46 The peak of Dutch drainage activity between 1600 and 1625 coincided with the ‘golden age’ of the Dutch economy and landscape art.

Simply keeping warm in winter required up to 10 cubic metres of fuel wood per family per year, the growth of 4 ha (10 a) of mature forest. A village of 100 families relying on wood for fuel would have needed access to up to 400 ha (1,000 a) of forest.50 An awareness of the undesirable environmental impacts of deforestation and erosion is evident in mid-fifteenth-century Venice, where the high rate of woodland clearance in the Veneto increased the volume of silt brought down by the rivers into the lagoon surrounding the city. From the mid-sixteenth century, local shortages forced Venice to draw timber supplies from the other side of the Adriatic.51 Everywhere timber was in demand for making charcoal for iron smelting. Charcoal was a much more efficient source of heat than wood, but 5–10 kg (11–22 lb) of wood were required to make 1 kg (2.2 lb) of charcoal.52 Although the iron industry was becoming increasingly concentrated in areas such as the Basque Country and the Milan district, which had high-quality iron ores, reserves of nearby timber for charcoal and access to markets by river and coastal transport, low-grade iron was produced much more widely. It has been established since the 1970s that the old idea of England’s woodlands being depleted by the charcoal iron industry, forcing it to retreat from southern areas of production like the Weald ever northwards and westwards in search of new fuel supplies, is a misunderstanding.

While deforestation has been studied in some detail, the scale of peat removal by small-scale cutting or larger-scale extraction, and the impact of this on the landscape, on drainage regimes and on vegetation patterns, has been greatly underestimated. In upland areas such as the south Pennines, a far greater quantity of peat may have been removed than from the Norfolk Broads. By the seventeenth century, in parts of north-east Scotland, surviving peat mosses had to be carefully managed to conserve the remaining resources for as long as possible, although the subsoils of worked-out peat bogs could sometimes be drained and reclaimed, if they did not flood, as was the case with Kilconquhar Loch in Fife.59 In areas where charcoal was not readily available, peat could be used for smelting lead or iron. Some Scottish island communities, without peat or timber, were forced to burn animal dung for fuel, despite its value as a fertilizer.60

As these examples show, virtual reality creates a virtual experience that cannot be known in any other form, a new form of reality generated by the -102- extreme specialization of computer technology. The user of virtual reality has an "interface" with the computer which provides him or her with physical access to a visualized world that is entirely "interior," in that it cannot be experienced in the three-dimensional world of everyday life, and yet is convincingly "real" (Woolley 1992). There are two crucial differences between computer-generated virtual reality and the other forms of virtuality that have been discussed above. The viewpoint onto the virtual environment is controlled by the user not the medium. That is to say, when we watch a film or a television program, we have no choice as to how to look at the scene represented. The camera's point of view inevitably becomes ours. While we may chose to identify with the Indians rather than the cowboys, we cannot stop the cowboys from winning. In virtual reality users are no longer confined to a single viewpoint but can change their relationship to the space at will. At the same time, the virtual environment is now interactive, meaning that the user can alter the conditions he or she discovers within certain limits. This interactive, user-controlled dimension to virtual reality takes it beyond the traditional picture space, even if it inevitably retains the three-dimensional space of traditional geometry.

Granted, the cultural sphere is all-encompassing, since in it we find animals, plants and spirits which other Amerindian societies place in the realm of nature.

How can this Constitution be described? I have chosen to concentrate on an exemplary situation that arose at the very beginning of its drafting, in the middle of the seventeenth century, when the natural philosopher Robert Boyle and the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes were arguing over the distribution of scientific and political power. Such a choice might appear arbitrary if a remarkable book had not just come to grips with this double creation of a social context and a nature that escapes that very context.

Hobbes defines a naked and calculating citizen who constitutes the Leviathan, a mortal god, an artificial creature. On what does the Leviathan depend ? On the calculation of human atoms that leads to the contract that decides on the irreversible composition of the strength of all in the hands of a single one. In what does this strength consist? In the authorization granted by all naked citizens to a single one to speak in their name. Who is acting when that one acts? We are, we who have definitively delegated our power to him. The Republic is a paradoxical artificial creature composed of citizens united only by the authorization given to one of them to represent them all. Does the Sovereign speak in his own name, or in the name of those who empower him ? This is an insoluble question with which modern political philosophy will grapple endlessly. It is indeed the Sovereign who speaks, but it is the citizens who are speaking through him. He becomes their spokesperson, their persona, their personification. He translates them; therefore he may betray them . . They empower him: therefore they may impeach him. The Leviathan is made up only of citizens, calculations, agreements or disputes. In short, it is made up of nothing but social relations. Or rather, thanks to Hobbes and his successors, we are beginning to understand what is meant by social relations, powers, forces, societies. But Boyle defines an even stranger artifact. He invents the laboratory within which artificial machines create phenomena out of whole cloth. Even though they are artificial, costly and hard to reproduce, and despite the small number of trained and reliable witnesses, these facts indeed represent nature as it is. The facts are produced and represented in the laboratory, in scientific writings; they are recognized and vouched for by the nascent community of witnesses. Scientists are scrupulous representatives of the facts. Who is speaking when they speak? The facts themselves, beyond all question, but also their authorized spokespersons. Who is speaking, then, nature or human beings ? This is another insoluble question with which the modern philosophy of science will wrestle over the course of three centuries. In themselves, facts are mute; natural forces THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF THE MODERNS 29 are brute mechanisms. Yet the scientists declare that they themselves are not speaking; rather, facts speak for themselves. These mute entities are thus capable of speaking, writing, signifying within the artificial chamber of the laboratory or inside the even more rarefied chamber of the vacuum pump. Little groups of gentlemen take testimony from natural forces, and they testify to each other that they are not betraying but translating the silent behaviour of objects. With Boyle and his successors, we begin to conceive of what a natural force is, an object that is mute but endowed or entrusted with meaning.

As with any Constitution, this one has to be measured by the guarantees it offers. The natural power that Boyle and his many scientific descendants defined in opposition to Hobbes, the power that allows mute objects to speak through the intermediary of loyal and disciplined scientific spokespersons, offers a significant guarantee: it is not men who make Nature; Nature has always existed and has always already been there; we are only discovering its secrets. The political power that Hobbes and his many political descendants define in opposition to Boyle has citizens speak with one voice through the translation and betrayal of a sovereign, who says only what they say. This power offers an equally significant guarantee: human beings, and only human beings, are the ones who construct society and freely determine their own destiny.

If I am allowed to go on with the convenient fiction that this Constitution is drafted by some conscious agent endowed with will, foresight and cunning I could say that everything happens as if the moderns had applied the same doubling to the crossed-out God that they had used on Nature and Society. His transcendence distanced Him infinitely, so that He disturbed neither the free play of nature nor that of society, but the right was nevertheless reserved to appeal to that transcendence in case of conflict between the laws of Nature and those of Society. Modern men and women could thus be atheists even while remaining religious. They could invade the material world and freely re-create the social world, but without experiencing the feeling of an orphaned demiurge abandoned by all.

If I am right in this outline of the Constitution, modernity has nothing to do with the invention of humanism, with the emergence of the sciences, with the secularization of society, or with the mechanization of the world. Its originality and its strength come from the conjoined production of these three pairings of transcendence and immanence, across a long history of which I have presented only one stage via the figures of Hobbes and Boyle. The essential point of this modern Constitution is that it renders the work of mediation that assembles hybrids invisible, unthinkable, unrepresentable. Does this lack of representation limit the work of mediation in any way? No, for the modern world would immediately cease to function. Like all other collectives it lives on that blending. On the contrary (and here the beauty of the mechanism comes to light), the modern Constitution allows the expanded proliferation of the hybrids whose existence, whose very possibility, it denies.

By playing three times in a row on the same alternation between transcendence and immanence, the moderns can mobilize Nature, objectify the social, and feel the spiritual presence of God, even while firmly maintaining that Nature escapes us, that Society is our own work, and that God no longer intervenes. Who could have resisted such a construction?

Not all survival plans are quite as promising as that. One truly crazy idea for human survival appears at regular intervals in the media and in the minds of the venturesome. This is the notion that Mars could be a refuge for humanity if our life on Earth was in danger of being terminated. The assumption seems to be that the surface of Mars is not so different from that of the Saharan or Australian deserts. All that will be needed would be to drill down to an aquifer, just as they do in cities like Phoenix or Las Vegas in the United States. Then we could lead a comfortable civilized Martian life replete with casinos, golf courses and swimming pools.

Perhaps Mars could provide hermit cells for the ultra-rich who might spend half their fortunes on voluntarily travelling there.

So we are made by our star, which provides the energy for life, but we are also threatened by it. This star is a perfectly ordinary, somewhat small, middle-aged cosmic entity – a 5 billion-year-old main sequence star. Models of the Sun explain how it stays hot by fusing its hydrogen into helium in the ultra-incandescent regions of its interior. But just as burning coal in oxygen produces carbon dioxide, so fusing hydrogen produces helium. Both carbon dioxide and helium are greenhouse gases: the first warms the Earth, the second warms the Sun. This makes the inner regions of the Sun hotter and so increases the rate of fusion; the extra heat makes the Sun expand and from its greater surface area more heat escapes and warms the Earth. It will continue to increase its output of heat until, in 5 billion years’ time, it becomes a red giant star and slowly absorbs the Earth and the inner planets of the solar system.

In 1992 I published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society that was based on a conjecture by the biophysicist Alfred Lotka. He proposed that, contrary to expectation, it would be easier to model an ecosystem of many species if the physical environment were included, a very Gaian conclusion. Before speech and writing appeared, we and all other animals thought intuitively. Imagine a country walk where you come unexpectedly to the edge of a cliff, so high and so steep that one further step would lead to certain death. If this happens, your brain analyses the vision before you and in milliseconds unconsciously recognizes the danger. All further forward motion is inhibited. Recent measurements show that this instinctive reaction operates within 40 milliseconds of the recognition of danger. It happens well before you are conscious of the cliff. In other words, you are saved by instinct, not by rational conscious thoughts about the danger of falling. Human civilization took a bad turn when it began to denigrate intuition. Without it, we die. As Einstein said, ‘The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.’ Perhaps it happened because women's insights were rejected. How long ago was it when the first group of men referred to an idea they didn't like as ‘mere feminine intuition’? I suspect it occurred when we moved from hunting and gathering to living in cities. It was certainly embedded in ancient Greek philosophy. Socrates’ remark, ‘Nothing interesting happens outside the city walls’, seems applicable to urban life. But it comes at the cost of valuing conscious thought, debate and argument more highly than instinct. Conscious debate cost Socrates his life.

Science is never certain or exact. The best we can ever do is to express our knowledge in terms of its probability. We must understand that we are still primitive animals. There is a vast amount to be discovered about our universe that is comprehensible, but an unknown and probably far greater amount of it is quite ineffable and, as today, we will never understand it all. Because of a passionate desire for certainty, something that may have evolved during our hunter-gatherer phase, the information we have gathered about our world and the universe may be tinted by the colour of our faith or, more recently, political belief, but I think that this matters very little because as we grow wiser it is easy to distinguish the gem from the mud that encases it. Few things illustrate more clearly how misleading cause-and-effect logic can be than the invention of the non-existent planet Vulcan.

It may be that the cosmic anthropological principle put forward by Barrow and Tipler is the most sophisticated religious concept yet devised. But we don't need to go that far to embrace the idea that we are, indeed, chosen. This gives us cause to be proud, but not to be full of hubris, for our status carries enormous responsibilities. Think of us as a species like the first photosynthesizers. Those primitive unicellular organisms unconsciously discovered how to use the flood of energy in sunlight to make the food needed for their progeny and, at the same time, release into their world that magic – though deadly for many organisms – gas, oxygen. Without them there would now be no life on this planet. I think that our emergence as a species is as important as was the emergence of those light-harvesters 3 billion years ago.

The term ‘cyborg’ was coined by Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline in 1960. It refers to a cybernetic organism: an organism as self-sufficient as one of us but made of engineered materials. I like this word and definition because it could apply to anything ranging in size from a micro-organism to a pachyderm, from a microchip to an omnibus. It is now commonly taken to mean an entity that is part flesh, part machine. I use it here to emphasize that the new intelligent beings will have arisen, like us, from Darwinian evolution. They will not, at first, be separate from us; indeed, they will be our offspring because the systems we made turned out to be their precursors. We need not be afraid because, initially at least, these inorganic beings will need us and the whole organic world to continue to regulate the climate, keeping Earth cool to fend off the heat of the Sun and safeguard us from the worst effects of future catastrophes. We shall not descend into the kind of war between humans and machines that is so often described in science fiction because we need each other. Gaia will keep the peace. This is the age I call the Novacene. I'm sure that one day a more appropriate name will be chosen, something more imaginative, but for now I'm using ‘Novacene’ to describe what could be one of the most crucial periods in the history of our planet and perhaps even of the cosmos. Before exploring the Novacene, I need to describe how we reached this point through the workings of the age that preceded it. This is the period in which humans, the chosen species, developed technology which enabled them to intervene directly in the processes and structures of the entire planet. It is the age of fire in which we learned to exploit the captured sunlight of the distant past. It is known as the Anthropocene.

At this point I want to stress that the evolution of the Anthropocene – which has so massively changed the Earth – was driven by market forces. Had there been no economic gain from using Newcomen's steam engine, we might still be back in the world of the seventeenth century. The important feature of Newcomen's engine was its profitability. The mere idea of the engine would not have been enough to ensure its development. Its great significance – for good or ill – was because it was cheaper as a source of work than human or horse power.

The Industrial Revolution was an era that simultaneously brought great wealth and great poverty.

For me, the key point that justifies the definition of the Anthropocene as a new geological period is the radical change that took place when humans first began to convert stored solar energy into useful work. This makes the Anthropocene the second stage in the planet's processing of the power of the Sun. In the first stage the chemical process of photosynthesis enabled organisms to convert light into chemical energy. The third stage will be the Novacene, when solar energy is converted into information.

Cities are also natural in that they seem to follow the development of insect colonies. There are obvious similarities between the tower of a termite nest and the tall blocks of offices and flats that spring up in our contemporary cities. At first, I found this depressing. These human nests, like the termites’ towers, are often admirable architectural and engineering constructions. But the price for each termite seems huge. The individual worker who once lived freely on the plains now spends a lifetime gathering mud, mixing it with shit and sticking the smelly bundle into gaps in the walls of the nest or anywhere their in-built programme instructs. Is something akin to this egalitarian paradise a model of future urban life? Passing a contemporary office tower, it is hard to ignore the termite analogy – in glass boxes everybody is doing exactly the same thing, not mixing shit but staring at computer screens.

But what are the facts? First, we must view the Anthropocene as a period in which humans have the power to make globally significant decisions – the use of CFCs was one, as was the imposition of a ban on their use. These decisions can be wrong-headed and have unexpected outcomes, but the crucial point is that we have the power to make them. Secondly, we must abandon the politically and psychologically loaded idea that the Anthropocene is a great crime against nature. This is understandable to the extent that neither Newcomen's engine nor a nuclear power plant looks or behaves much like a zebra or an oak tree; they appear to be utterly different in every respect. Nevertheless, the truth is that, despite being associated with mechanical things, the Anthropocene is a consequence of life on Earth. It is a product of evolution; it is an expression of nature. Evolution by natural selection is often expressed in the statement, ‘The organism that leaves the most progeny is selected.’ The steam engine was certainly prolific, and so were its successors, which rapidly evolved through improvements by inventors such as James Watt. The process went on to become the Industrial Revolution and gave us a century of technical and scientific glory.

The needs of cyborgs are quite different from ours. Oxygen is a nuisance, not a vital necessity. There is far too much water for comfort.

Virtuality asks some intriguing questions about the definition of the body and, by extension, of the self. Virtual domains seem to be one example of the perception that the body need not stop at the skin but can be an open and complex structure. Virtual environments can thus be liberating for those with motor disabilities in allowing all users equal freedom of movement. For deaf people, cyberspace is at present one domain where no one can tell if you can hear. The proliferation of close-captioning devices, email, fax and TTD machines has allowed many deaf people a far greater degree of interaction with the hearing world than was previously possible. Video-conferencing permits long-distance sign-language conversations to take place for the first time. Perhaps even more remarkably, many autistic people have come to rely on the Internet as a means of communication, away from the distractions presented by N.T.s (Neurologically Typical). As one user describes it, this representational medium is far more interactive for the autistic person than real life encounters: "Reading faces is like looking into a rippling pond. I am too distracted by the edges, glints of light, to make much of it." For the writer Temple Grandin, who has autism, the Internet is a metaphor for her mind: "I talk Internet talk because there is nothing out there closer to how I think" (Blume 1997). As such experiences multiply, many are wondering what personal identity will come to mean in a virtual society.

But the user's freedom is explicitly limited by the ArchiText of the designers, who place themselves in the role of "God/ dess." The avatar may be "deceased" at any time or consigned to "Limbo," a space on the site where only names and statistics appear. Alternatively, users can and do opt to be placed in Limbo or the Necropolis, indicating that submission to power has its own pleasures. The most dramatic space is -113- known as "Showplace!!!," where the user's "body" is displayed for all to see. As the site description explains: "Immediately available is a mirror image of yourself. The camera zooms in, you feel an enormously warm and glowing light directly above you. Your image is projected onto a large billboard that millions of people are watching. Appearing larger than life gets you sexually aroused. You are being watched by countless eyes and through multiple lenses-all in sharp focus." This highly visualized, sensual experience of being both consumer and commodity at once can be seen as an expression of Netlife itself at the current moment, far from its original text-based formats.

WebTV is a literal convergence of the most successful mass medium of the modern period with the quintessential postmodern medium. It makes no effort to conceal or deny its artificiality using a proliferation of icons, picture-in-picture options and image-text interface. It is perhaps no coincidence that Microsoft's 1997 "Thank God It's Monday" advertising campaign made conspicuous use of pixelated imagery or that Chuck Close's seemingly pixelated portraits have become immensely popular, crowned by a one-person show at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1998.

If for centuries we have sought to see into artists' minds, now we look into their bodies and find only absences. The performance artist Stelarc (Stelios Arcadiou), who has suspended himself above the ground using cables attached through his skin (see Figure 3.8), and who has created cyborg performances with a third "arm" called Handswriting (1982) and Elapsed Horizon/Enhanced Assumption (1990), holds that "THE BODY IS OBSOLETE…It is no longer meaningful to see the body as a site for the psyche or the social but rather as a structure to be monitored and modified" (Dery 1996:160). Even the body has become virtual. For recent feminist criticism, the virtual body has become the starting point for new investigations of gender, sexuality and identity. Donna Haraway has argued that all bodies are becoming cyborgs, losing the earlier sense that the human was essentially different from animals on the one hand and machines on the other. There is danger and opportunity here: A cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in Star Wars, apocalypse waged in the name of defense, about the -120- Figure 3.8 Stelarc with cables through his skin final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war. From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints.

Farmers have been producing hybrids by trial and error for millennia but these deliberate interventions at the microscopic level clearly seem to open up a new arena. There are already genetically engineered tomatoes-firmer and longer lasting-under consideration at the Food and Drug Administration, while British stores already sell genetically engineered tomato paste. Scientists have tried to minimize the importance of these developments as simply small additions to existing procedures. While this may be true, everything seems to have changed at the conceptual level. Where is the boundary between human, animal and vegetable now located?'

This question recalls the manner in which the very notion of the human was established in Western culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

This question recalls the manner in which the very notion of the human was established in Western culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In his study The Order of Things, philosopher Michel Foucault argued that what we now call the humanities or human sciences "appeared when man constituted himself in Western culture as both that which must be conceived of and that which is to be known" (Foucault 1970:345). He showed that the new concepts of life as the principle of biology, wealth as the creator of new forms of production, and language as the key to knowledge, created in this period became the basis for the development of the humanities. At the end of his book, Foucault made his most famous and most derided prediction: "If those arrangements were to disappear as they appeared, if some event of which we can at the moment do no more than sense the possibility…were to cause them to crumble, as the ground of Classical thought did, at the end of the eighteenth century, then one can certainly wager that man would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea" (Foucault 1970:387). Thirty years after Foucault wrote those words, his wager may be coming to pass. For the classical notions of labor as being the basis of wealth production that is measured in money have disappeared into the electronic complexities of the global market, where those who make the most money are people who buy, break up and sell companies without producing anything. With the invention of cloning, the basis of biology can no longer be taken to be naturally occuring life, for life forms exist that were created solely by human intervention. The last teetering leg of the human tripod then is the science of language as the unifying -122- principle of the human sciences that has generated so much controversy over the last three decades.

The fear is that in a visual culture, humanity may find itself in a "serene non-existence" (386), unable even to frame the new paradigm. While such a crisis appears highly unlikely, there is certainly a localized crisis of the humanities within the Western university system. It will not be resolved by pretending that nothing has happened. Visual culture exists and it is now the task of intellectuals to find ways to represent it in a world where the humanistic distinction between the real and the virtual has dissolved.

In Freud's view, the fetish is always a penis-substitute: "To put it plainly: the fetish is the substitute for the woman's (mother's) phallus which the little boy once believed in and does not wish to forego." The little boy had believed that his mother possessed a phallus just as he did, until at some point he becomes aware that her genitals are different from his, that she lacks a penis. There is an obvious threat: "if a woman can be castrated then his own penis is in danger." The boy is both aware of what he has seen and denies it: "He retains this belief but he also gives it up." The fetishist displaces his belief in the female phallus onto the fetish object, "possibly the last impression received before the uncanny traumatic one." While relatively few men actually become clinical fetishists, this trauma is universal: "Probably no male human being is spared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the female genitals.

Lacan's scheme was highly controversial in clinical psychoanalysis but has become widely adopted in visual culture studies, especially film criticism. This mode of interpretation was especially associated with the British film journal Screen that published a now celebrated essay theorizing visual experience in Lacanian terms by film critic Laura Mulvey in 1975 (Mulvey 1989). She analyzed the operations of visual pleasure in classic Hollywood cinema, arguing that the "paradox of phallocentrism…is that it depends on the image of the castrated woman to give order and meaning to its world." It is the woman's lack of the phallus, or symbolic castration, that initiates the formation of the ego and a signifying system that nonetheless excludes women. While the male hero initiates action, "women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness." Nonetheless, female characters still evoked the specter of castration that needed to be controlled. The woman may be punished in the film to overcome the threat in a sadistic form of voyeurism, or it may be disavowed by fetishism. Just as Mulvey sees castration anxiety as being at the heart of cinematic pleasure, Freud regarded fetishism as clear proof of his theory that men are haunted by the fear of castration, while women are marked by their lack of the phallus. Both formations derive from early visual experience that -165- causes the infant to adopt a specific view of what she or he has seen, whether of denial, assimilation or displacement. Fetishism led Freud to conclude that even when a "very important part of reality had been denied by the ego," the result was not necessarily psychosis but merely everyday neurosis. From a psychoanalytic standpoint, reality is in the eye of the beholder. Lacan's reading of psychoanalysis, which privileges the gaze, has obvious affinities with a reading of cinema as an apparatus for the control of the look.

Lacan's reading of psychoanalysis, which privileges the gaze, has obvious affinities with a reading of cinema as an apparatus for the control of the look. In Mulvey's analysis, the visual pleasure of cinema became a suspect category open by definition only to men. It was to be challenged by the deliberately difficult work of avant-garde cinema, whose goal was "to free the look of the camera into its materiality in time and space and the look of the audience into dialectics, passionate detachment." This austere prescription has failed to win over mass audiences who have continued to prefer the stylized cinematic styles of Hollywood, Bombay and Hong Kong over alternative cinema.

Identity is neither cultural nor natural in terms of the binary opposition but -173- is a formation in constant flux, drawing on physical, psychical and creative resources to create a sense of self or selves from a range of possibilities that are fractal rather than linear. There cannot be an opposition between a "Western" and "non-Western" body. The case of intersex children shows that even the most fundamental markers of identity are open to question in all locations.

The Congo river is a place where the boundaries between subject and object seem to dissolve into identities that we once called postmodern but we can now see to have been modern all along. That seeing is not a matter of Cartesian observation but of viewing from the "perverse angle" (Sedgwick) with the "parallax vision" (Mayne) of "(be)hindsight" (Edelman) that once seemed the marginal viewpoint but increasingly seems the only available place from which to look at the colonial spectacle, which, as the Situationists pithily observed, came home to the colonizing nations creating what they called "the colonization of everyday life."

One of the most powerful formats for this kind of transformative imaginary has been science fiction films and television programs because, in Constance Penley's words, "science fiction film as a genre…is now more hyperbolically concerned than ever with the question of difference, typically posed as that of the difference between human and non-human" (Penley et al. 1991:vii). Yet these films are in themselves careful to restore normality after the disruption caused by the intervention of aliens. It has been the fans of series like Star Trek and The X-Files who have created a flexible mediascape in which the question of difference can be articulated and re-imagined. The imaginary encounter with non-humans has served as a flexible metaphor for "first contact," from 1492 to the science fiction of the Cold War era, only to find in the postmodern moment that it can no longer account adequately for the difference it sets out to explain.

At the same time, the postwar boom was creating an advanced consumer culture in which people not only aspired to own goods but desired products that were not yet available or did not even exist. Such consumer demand for the future began with the annual updating of car models and continues today with AT&T promoting hi-tech products that are no more than ideas. As a result, audiences became accustomed to imagining the future in very specific terms and to judging different versions of that future against each other. It was this curious fusion of consumer desire and political rhetoric that was to give the science fiction genre its particular resonance, in an early version of what Alluquère Roseanne Stone has called the "war of technology and desire."

In semiotic terms, the alien image is a floating signifier. That is to say, the visual image of the alien is interpreted as such only with reference to other visualizations of aliens and with no reference to "real" extraterrestials. Thus the signifier can "float" from one meaning, or signified, to the next, generating different meanings in each context. In theory, all signs can do this, but in practice, a signifier becomes conventionally attached to a specific meaning in order to make everyday life comprehensible. There are certain signifiers that do float, however, such as the word "thing." I can say "pass me that thing" and it may be perfectly comprehensible to you in context as meaning "pass me the can opener", or it may make no sense, inviting the query "what thing"? The alien is one example of such floating signifiers that take on complex resonances of race, gender and politics.

Feminist theorist Donna Haraway has issued another challenge to the scientific notion of observation, arguing that "vision is always a question of the power to see." Instead, she calls for the creation of "situated knowledges" that accept the inevitably partial viewpoint of such knowledges: "Vision requires instruments of vision; an optics is a politics of positioning. Instruments of vision mediate standpoints; there is no immediate vision from the standpoints of the subjugated" (Haraway 1991:193). Someone watching a movie or sitting in front of the television is at first in the position of the subjugated, bound to follow the plot as given by the film or program makers. Yet many fans refuse to be limited to the given point of view. They stretch the narrative, create alternative interpretations and reimagine the endings. In a sense, they refuse to stay put in the body of the spectator as predicted by the film and television apparatus and become aliens, looking in ways that should not be possible. A number of early science fiction films like It Came From Outer Space and The Fly (1958) did in fact attempt to represent the alien way of seeing (Sobchak 1987:93-4). Although First Contact does represent the Borg looking at Captain Picard, there is no sense in which the viewer is invited to identify with that point of view. An alien in Independence Day is shown looking at a missile countdown only to emphasize human superiority. The alien way of seeing is one that is excluded from modern power structures, just as colonial culture excised the point of view of the colonized. In terms of challenging geopolitical power structures, it is of course a weak point of view to adopt. Most Star Trek fans do not envisage overthrowing the United Federation of Planets. But in an everyday life where so many people are treated as aliens by their own societies, it can be very liberating to engage actively with the alien point of view, to boldly go where no one has gone before. In a time when there seems to be no politics in politics itself, the act of imagining a different future is a social practice that has extended but unpredictable cultural effects.

In this view, Diana was an emblem of visual culture, itself feminized in relation to the Word, a pop princess who liked Duran Duran, Wham! and John Travolta rather than more critically-approved music, in short someone who embodied what the British mean by the withering term "vulgar." Popular culture has been received into the academy on the basis that it "really" allows people to address serious issues behind the surface vulgarity. Diana's death forces us to realize that the distinction is, like all such distinctions, a form of élitism that wants to separate the serious wheat of popular experience from the chaff of its vulgarity.

British Left, from which cultural studies originated, was so badly wrong about the Diana phenomenon precisely because of its profound distrust for images and appearance. By the time of her death, Diana had become a global visual icon whose image was disseminated via all three varieties of modern visuality discussed in this book. Her image was so extraordinarily powerful because it incorporated the formal image of royalty, the popular photograph and the virtual image. In her passing, Diana caused this unlikely overlay to fall apart. Much of the general sense of -233- dislocation that followed her death can be attributed to this disruption of the symbolic order of everyday life. As a member of the British royal family, she benefited from the echo of power that adheres to the formal image of royalty. Indeed, her dramatic success in this role made it clear that the monarchy mattered in a way that most commentators had assumed it did not. As early as the 1950s, the popular press was criticizing Queen Elizabeth II for being aloof and rarely smiling, a perception that became widespread in the 1960s (Kelley 1997:202). In 1969, the Queen had worn a simple dress and hat rather than robes and a diadem for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in response to pressure from Welsh nationalist sentiment. During the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, Britain seemed divided over whether to celebrate or mourn the event. While many areas organized street parties and other celebrations, the Sex Pistols' ironically titled single "God Save the Queen" was at the top of the charts, despite being banned by the BBC. The New Statesman magazine, an influential center-left journal, published an Anti-Jubilee issue in which it recorded what some nine-year-olds in North London had written about the monarchy. One typical comment ran: "I don't like the Queen because she is too posh. She is too fussy. She looks like the Joker with her white face and red lipstick and she looks like a puff porcupine with those dresses and she thinks too much of herself and she doesn't care about the poor" (Fenton 1977). This critique concentrates on appearances. The Queen's clothes seem out of touch and her self-presentation makes her look like a comic-book villain rather than a hero. In the words of the Sex Pistols, "she ain't no human being." The former school-child would have been 29 at the time of Diana's death, typical of so many mourners in the streets of London.

Yet in the same issue, the New Statesman had editorialized that "the monarchy is a dead hand, and that is bad enough: but it is a dead hand that could come dangerously alive…[given that] parliamentary democracy is extensively discredited in the popular mind and not entirely secure." The monarchy was discussed as if it was still central to issues of governance, even though the royals themselves did their best to stay out of party politics. In 1981, when Charles and Diana were married, feminists wore buttons saying "Don't Do it Di," while many others saw the spectacle as a crude attempt to distract attention from the problems of mass unemployment at the time. Indeed, the Queen and Prince Charles both distanced themselves from Mrs. Thatcher's policies, strengthening the peculiar alliance between the aristocratic British Left and the monarchy. Ironically, it was Diana herself who achieved what decades of leftist and republican comment had not, the thorough-going discrediting of the monarchy, working through the mass media. In such popular histories lies the movement noticed by Darcus Howe. For people like the North London -234- school-child, Diana was simply the last chance of the old system to put on a human face.

Diana's story was told in photographs. It has frequently been emphasized in the aftermath of her death that she was in some sense the creature of the media, or even that she manipulated photographs by posing for them, as if it was somehow possible to ignore the banks of cameras that attended her every move. More to the point, as Roland Barthes told us, "what founds the nature of photography is the pose" (Barthes 1981:78). Like Madonna, Diana had raised the art of posing to new heights. But, as Madonna has often said, there is nothing inherently novel about such self-fashioning, which is typical of young women who follow fashion and popular music.

Diana served as a punctum in herself for all kinds of meanings, just as many celebrities have done. Wayne Koestenbaum argues in his study of Jackie Onassis, for example, that for her fans: "In most photographs including Jackie, she is the punctum" (Koestenbaum 1995:239). What is most striking about such photographs is that the studium and punctum in fact overlap in the person of the celebrity. The viewer scans the celebrity body and checks it against a wide range of remembered references to see if the star is looking "good" or "bad." The fetishistic viewing of celebrities creates a punctum effect of the first kind described by Barthes-a personal attraction to particular aspects of the image that is derived from whimsy, desire and memory. The second type of punctum is far more powerful: "this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow and pierces me" (Barthes 1981:26). Diana, child of a broken home, bulimic, divorced, single mother and victim of a fatal accident, came to serve as a mass media punctum for personal loss. What made such effects possible in Diana's case was the sheer volume of her photographic image. Whether you were a fan or not, her face was unavoidable, a seeming constant in the everchanging flow of global media.

"These images of the female body reenact, obsessively, the moment of the female subject's earliest self-awareness, as if to suggest the subject's profound uncertainty over whether her own subjectivity 'took.'

The global media public found in Diana the first icon of the new age of the electronic image and the instantaneous distribution of images. One consequence was a certain flattening of perspective on the event, the homogenization that is one aspect of global culture. Newspapers around the world carried highly emotive stories taken directly from the British press rather than having their own journalists create accounts from local perspectives, even in countries that have good historical reason to resent British royalty like Zimbabwe.

The image, says phenomenology, is an object-as-nothing. Now, in the Photograph, what I posit is not only the absence of the object; it is also, by one and the same movement, on equal terms, the fact that this object has indeed existed and that it has been where I see it. Here is where the madness is, for until this day no representation could assure me of the past of a thing except by intermediaries; but with the Photograph, my certainty is immediate…. The Photograph then becomes a bizarre medium, a new form of hallucination: false on the level of perception, true on the level of time….

Although Diana had lived her life in dialog with photography, her death was above all a televisual event. For all the countless websites that were created in her honor, none matched the creativity and spontaneity of what could be seen live on television. The Internet is an admirable information resource but does not yet have television's capacity for "live" reporting. This was an event where the world really was watching. While 750 million people had watched her marriage, and another 200 million her interview on British television in 1995, a staggering 2.5 billion people are estimated to have watched her funeral. If this figure is correct, it means that of the three-quarters of the world's population who have access to television, no less than 80 percent were watching. London police had expected a crowd of six million people but in the end most Britons experienced the funeral like the rest of the world on television. The largest portion of the London crowd gathered in Hyde Park to watch the event on giant television screens that had been specially flown over from Hong Kong, where they had been used during the ceremonies marking the return of the British colony to China. In two different ways, those screens registered the final death of the nineteenth-century imperial monarchy created by Queen Victoria. Diana's funeral was the inaugural of the pixelated planet.

For it is no longer possible to suggest that the mass audience will gullibly consume any product that is offered to it containing a simple formula of entertainment. Interestingly, of the mass media, television seems more at threat from these changes than cinema. The success of Titanic (1997) made film seem full of commercial possibilities. It is worth noting that this was a triumph created more by audiences than critics or other industry insiders, many of whom predicted failure. Even after its success, the Academy -255- pointedly gave Titanic no Oscars for acting or screenwriting, even though it was the story that made the film so popular, especially with young women. Highbrow critics in France and Germany perceived the film as an allegory for class division and the collapse of modernism, while the British Academy of Film and Television Arts found it unworthy to receive any of its annual awards. For all the colossal budget and special effects required to make Titanic, it was ultimately successful because audiences came to see it despite the media consensus in many countries that it was a poor film. Many American film critics felt the need to bemoan the fact that L.A. Confidential, an enjoyable film noir parody, had been passed over in favor of Titanic at both the box office and the Academy Awards. On the other hand, Egyptian and Indian audiences enjoyed Titanic while they had found Independence Day patronizing and narrowly focussed on American concerns. For all the weaknesses of the script, Titanic was open to a variety of interpretations and perspectives that spectators globally found appealing in different ways.

On the other hand, when differing factions of Iranians used the USA versus Iran soccer match in the 1998 World Cup to display their competing banners and emblems, the global media were used to circumvent local censorship.

Even the most terrifyingly real of all human creations, the atomic bomb, is now being imagined in a visual context. When India detonated an atomic device in May 1998, her foreign minister laid down a challenge to Pakistan in words taken directly from Indian cinematic cliché: "All they have to do is tell us the time and the place." The weapon was named after Agni, the Hindu god of fire, also evoking such movie classics as Amitabh Bachchan's Agnipath (The Path of Fire) (Sardar 1998:11). The Indian government, dominated by the Hindu BJP Party, has sought to transform the traditional Hindu ritual of purification by fire into a new cinematic context, at once -258- local and global, to which mostly Muslim Pakistan responded in kind. This standoff was a riposte to the West in several ways. First, it recast the Reaganite vocabulary of "Star Wars" in terms of Indian cinema. Second, by evoking the traditional energy of fire, it provided a counterpoint to the endless exaltation of electricity in current Western discourse. Finally, it challenged those who think that globalization is simply a euphemism for Americanization. None of these points is meant to condone or justify the expansion of nuclear weaponry, which is clearly a disaster for all concerned. Yet the incident shows the intricate ways in which the real and the virtual are now imbricated, mediated by the visual image. Fire has recurred as an image throughout this book, from the fire at the heart of Plato's cave to the fire-shaped pictorial design system invented by Michelangelo, the funeral pyres of the sati, and the multiple fires and weaponry of science-fiction film. In this way, the genealogy of visual culture outlined in this book could be told through the imagery of fire. Fire is an image that is at once archaic, modern, and postmodern. It is at once a code, a symbol, an icon and a message without a code. That is to say, it is something that has material existence, that is both visible and interfaced with language. What is visual culture? Right now, it's on fire.

We seem to have forgotten that science is not wholly based on theory and models: more tiresome and prosaic confirmation by experiment and observation plays just as important a part. Perhaps for social reasons, science has in recent years changed its way of working. Observation in the real world and small‐scale experiments on the Earth now take second place to expensive and ever‐expanding theoretical models. It may be administratively and politically convenient to work this way but the consequences could be disastrous. Our tank is near empty of data and we are running on theoretical vapour: this is especially true of data about the oceans that make up over 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface, and about the responses of ecosystems to climate change – and, just as importantly, the effect of change in the oceans and ecosystems on the climate.

Those of us who still walk in what was once the countryside sense that something is wrong or missing when we see a modern agri‐business farm, with its fields full of monoculture crops, and we feel the same about dark gloomy forestry plantations of conifers sown in regimented ranks close together to maximize the quantity and quality of the timber and the foresters’ gain. A few of us find it terribly wrong when some jewel of coastline or rural scenery is debased by plantations of giant industrial‐scale wind turbines. Yet if we go to untouched forest, desert or indeed any place on Earth where things still grow in dynamic coexistence, we find it beautiful but scary, a place that alerts our sense of danger. The extrovert explorer in his bush hat will say, ‘Nonsense, I have spent much of my life in the wilderness and never felt threatened.’ He forgets that he also wears snake boots, and his kit carries water‐sterilizing tablets and anti‐malarial pills.

Some parts of the world may escape the worst. The northern regions of Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia, where not inundated by the rising ocean, will remain habitable and so will oases on the continents, mostly in mountain regions where rain or snow still fall. But the more important exceptions to this planet‐wide distress will be the island nations of Japan, Tasmania, New Zealand, the British Isles and numerous smaller islands. Even in the tropics, global heating may not disable island communities such as those on the Hawaiian Islands, Taiwan or the Philippines. The British Isles and New Zealand will be among the least affected by global heating. Their temperate oceanic position is likely to favour a climate able to sustain abundant agriculture. They will be among the lifeboats for humanity. For the nations that occupy the continents, all may depend on their population density. The USA and the Russian states are singularly fortunate in having densities 8 and 30 times less than the UK respectively and both contain vast areas of previously frozen territory in their northern regions.

The trouble with mankind is, as William James said, ‘Man can never have enough without having too much.’ Once biofuel is used to keep our cars and trucks moving we will try to grow it globally, with appalling consequences. To give some idea of the scale already involved, consider the energy legislation enacted in 2007 in the USA, which envisages some $170 billion for biofuel refineries and their infrastructure. Brent Erikson, of the Biotechnology Industry Organization said, ‘We are at the point where we were in the 1850s when kerosene was first distilled,’ and he went on to say that the new law requires the production of 36 billion gallons of ethanol fuel from corn kernels by 2022. It is clear from Mr Erikson’s statements, and from what is now happening in Brazil and from the European intentions, that biofuels are not some harmless cottage industry: they are big business as usual.

Policies based on unjustifiable extrapolation and environmental dogmas are unlikely to avert climate change and we should not even try to implement them. Instead our leaders should immediately concentrate their minds on sustaining their own nations as a viable habitat; they could be inspired to do this not just out of selfish national interest but as captains of the lifeboats that their nations might become. In early 2008 the UK government at last announced a programme for building new nuclear power stations. I surely hope that this is not another of the false promises that characterized so many of the utterances of the Blair administration. Nuclear energy is by far the most effective way to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, but that is not the most important reason for us to emulate France and make electricity from uranium. What is important is that cities demand a constant and economic supply of electricity which until recently has come from coal and gas but these are now declining and leave no alternative to nuclear energy. Huge flows of electricity will be demanded by the mega‐cities that are starting to emerge and this can only be met in the near term by a vigorous and rapid expansion of nuclear energy. This need is intensified by the fact that we have little land on which to grow food and intensive agriculture needs abundant energy. As oil runs out we will need to synthesize fuel for the mobile machinery of construction, transport and agriculture. This is not difficult to do from coal or nuclear energy but we need to start preparing for it now. We may even have to consider the direct synthesis of food from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water and tissue culture. There will be a flood of anti‐nuclear energy disinformation from energy companies whose profitability is threatened and even from nations who see their power and influence lessened. Do not believe such tales as that the construction of a new nuclear power source takes ten to fifteen years. Construction takes the French less than five years and there is no reason why we should take longer, if we avoid the excessive time spent in planning agencies, courtrooms and at public hearings. I hope that the green movement and their attendant lawyers do not continue their mistaken opposition to nuclear energy.

When I am warned that my pessimism discourages those who would improve their carbon footprint or do good works such as planting trees, I’m afraid I see such efforts as at best romantic nonsense, or at worst hypocrisy. Agencies now exist which allow air travellers to plant trees to offset the extra carbon dioxide their plane adds to the overburdened air. How like the indulgences once sold by the Catholic Church to wealthy sinners to offset the time they might otherwise spend in purgatory. Thirty years ago I foolishly planted 20,000 trees, hoping to restore to nature the farmland I had bought. I now realize it was a mistake: I should have left the land untouched and let an ecosystem, a natural forest, emerge filled with biodiverse and abundant life, in Gaia’s own time. Unlike a mere plantation, such a forest could evolve, or die if it had to, as the climate changed. Planting a tree does not make an ecosystem any more than putting a liver in a jar fed with blood and nutrients makes a man.

What might do so are the disastrous consequences of sea level rise leading to the destruction of a major city or the failure of food or electricity supplies. These dangers will be aggravated by the ever‐growing flux of climate refugees, to which will be added returning expatriates who left the crowded United Kingdom for what they thought would be a pleasant life in Europe.

Before long, we may face planet‐wide devastation worse even than unrestricted nuclear war between superpowers. The climate war could kill nearly all of us and leave the few survivors living a Stone Age existence. But in several places in the world, including the UK, we have a chance of surviving and even of living well. For that to be possible we have to make our lifeboats seaworthy now. Even if some natural event such as a series of large volcanic eruptions or a decrease of solar radiation reprieves us, it still will have been better to spend our money and our efforts making our countries self‐sufficient in food and energy and, if we are to become wholly urban, then in making cities that we are proud to live in.

The melting of floating ice does not significantly raise sea level, as Archimedes could have advised had he been asked, but it does make a difference to the quantity of heat received by the Earth from the sun. White, snow‐covered ice reflects 80 per cent of the sunlight back to space but dark sea water reflects only 20 per cent of the sunlight that strikes it. The extra heating of the Arctic basin if all the floating ice melted would be 80 watts per m2, which averaged over the whole Earth is an increase of one watt per m2. This is a truly serious increase of the Earth’s heat load. To put it in perspective, the extra heat which will be absorbed when the floating ice has gone is nearly 70 per cent of the heating caused by all of the carbon dioxide pollution now present.

The background planetary science that should be the basis for professional climatology has been in a state of flux and conflict for at least two hundred years. Many natural philosophers from the nineteenth century and earlier realized there was a link between life and the material Earth but even Erasmus Darwin, T. H. Huxley and V. Vernadsky did not go much further than anecdotal speculation. Proper science, which is the building of testable hypotheses, did not happen in this field until the twentieth century when the recognition of links between life at the surface and in the ocean led the great but insufficiently recognized scientists G. E. Hutchinson, A. C. Redfield and Lars Sillen to research the biochemistry of the ocean and land surface. And, quite naturally, they called their science biogeochemistry and established it as a separate discipline, and one now prominent in European science. It is important to note that biogeochemistry, like biochemistry in medical science, is not a systems science. It is not a physiology of the Earth and few biogeochemists would be happy to think of the Earth as in any way alive. For those unfamiliar with the niceties of scientific naming, the last science in a compound name of that kind is usually the leader, thus biochemists and biogeochemists are chemists by training who are working with life and its products, and biophysics is done by physicists working on biological subjects. Geophysiology, the discipline of Gaia theory, had its origins in the 1960s Gaia hypothesis. Geophysiology sees the organisms of the Earth evolving by Darwinian natural selection in an environment that is the product of their ancestors and not simply a consequence of the Earth’s geological history. Thus the oxygen of the atmosphere is almost wholly the product of photosynthetic organisms and without it there would be no animals or invertebrates, nor would we burn fuels and so add carbon dioxide to the air. I find it amazing that it took so long for biologists even grudgingly to acknowledge that organisms adapted not to the static world conveniently but wrongly described by their geologist colleagues, but to a dynamic world built by the organisms themselves.

The eminent climate scientist James Hansen, head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, has called for a far greater reduction in carbon dioxide than recently proposed by the European Union (EU). Hansen stated that the 550 parts per million upper limit proposed by Europe is far too high and that it should be as low as 350 ppm if humanity wishes to keep a planet similar to the one on which civilization developed. His strong statements are based on recent observations and on the Earth’s climate history and, although he does not say it explicitly, I think he realizes that models based on atmospheric physics alone are unable to predict the future climate.

It is important to recognize that dynamic self‐regulating systems such as you, me or the Earth will, if sufficiently stressed, change from stabilizing negative feedback to destabilizing positive feedback. When this happens they become amplifiers of change. As amplifiers they do not distinguish between heating and cooling so that a small decrease of heating has a larger effect than might be anticipated and can cause a noticeable drop in temperature. Then suddenly, between 400 and 500 ppm of carbon dioxide, a small increase of heat or carbon dioxide causes a sudden 5°C rise of temperature. After that the model planet stabilizes again and resists further increases of carbon dioxide. The Earth’s atmospheric greenhouse is now well above 400 ppm (carbon dioxide is near 390 ppm but methane, nitrous oxide and the CFCs lift the total effect to nearer that of 430 ppm carbon dioxide).

As if this were not enough, the American scientist Professor V. Ramanathan has recently drawn attention to the huge output of smoke and other aerosols from the fast‐growing industries of Asia. The smoke cloud from China now stretches across the Pacific Ocean to North America and the sunsets in California have a rosy tinge redolent of a similar light‐scattering by the stratospheric haze from the volcano Pinatubo that erupted in 1991. The same light‐scattering is occurring over the Indian Ocean as India expands its industry. These are new aerosol additions to the atmosphere: the smoke clouds from North America and Europe have moved similar distances for several decades across the Atlantic Ocean and into Asia. In addition to this, global smog from industry, smoke from burning forests in Africa, South America and from wildfires in the boreal forests of Canada and Siberia are all adding their ingredients to the witches’ brew that the atmosphere has become. Ramanathan has alerted us to the fact that these new pollution clouds are considerably darker than their predecessors from the US and Europe. They contain soot that absorbs sunlight, whereas the lighter aerosols mainly reflect sunlight. This makes the assessment of their effect on climate even more difficult.

All that we have now are uncertain numbers attached to the numerous separated parts of the system and guidance from Gaia theory: we are like a nineteenth‐century physician trying to give a sensible prognosis to a patient with diabetes. We can only make vague generalizations about the future, and were it not for the large and unquestioned greenhouse‐heating effect of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases we would indeed be in the dark. A splendid account of our understanding so far of this complex science is in Robert Charlson’s chapter of the book Earth System Science, published in 2001. To me, the message from aerosol and cloud research is that the global heating already experienced would be more severe without their presence, therefore we need to commit climate funding for monitoring and research.

According to Ian Woodward in a recent Nature paper, the leaf temperature of trees in sunlight is self‐regulated at close to 21°C; this temperature appears to be optimal for photosynthesis and is independent of the tree’s geographic location, occurring in Arctic as well as in tropical regions. The leaf temperature is regulated by evapotranspiration. I have observed in the southern English summer that dark conifer‐tree leaves maintain a surface temperature more than 40°C cooler than an inert surface of the same colour. On the scale of a forest as large as Amazonia or the boreal forests of Siberia, this has a huge effect on regional climate. Richard Betts and his colleagues at the Hadley Centre have pioneered the investigation into leaf temperature and its effects on both climate and the carbon cycle. As the leaves stay close to their optimal temperature physiologically the absorbed radiant energy of sunlight is mainly transformed into the latent heat of evaporation. It takes nearly 600 calories to evaporate a gram of water and meteorologists call the warmth stored this way ‘insensible heat’. What some atmospheric physicists seem unaware of is the link between climate and the physiology of the ecosystem of the forest. When the strong feedbacks implicit in this link are included, especially the way a vast forest can melt away like the floating polar ice, it affects global as well as local climate. Feedbacks on the large regional scale may lead to punctuations of the kind illustrated in Figure 3.

At this point I feel that a more general observation about climate change is needed. If we stand back and consider all the other perturbations possible to our self‐regulating Earth, we see that the presence of 7 billion people aiming for first‐world comforts is too much. It is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system. Instability in any of these other properties of the Earth is potentially as disturbing as climate change and interacts with it. The acidification of the oceans by excess carbon dioxide is a single example of this multiplex pathology caused by an excess of affluent humans.

The consequences of our overgrowth and its emissions are only slightly different from those caused by the photosynthesizers (single‐cell plants) who also grew and multiplied 2 billion or so years ago, and so changed their world that whole ranges of anaerobic ecosystems were condemned to an underground existence. Their pollution was oxygen, a poisonous, carcinogenic and fire‐raising gas that life, including us, has evolved to benefit from. Like the photosynthesizers, we could not have avoided reaching our current overpopulated and unsustainable state. We are what we are and there is little that we could have done to avoid what now seem adverse changes; we should not feel guilty about it.

Industrialists are not greedier or more insensitive than the rest of us, but tax and subsidy distort their ability to make a profit and so they will usually choose inefficient but profitable sources of energy and agricultural products over long‐term sensible and efficient but less profitable choices. This is why industry will back renewables, carbon trading and biofuels, which are neither efficient nor sensible, but are immediately profitable. Nuclear energy is profitable, even without subsidy, but, as with the purchase of a house through a mortgage, the profit is deferred. In the present economic climate distorted by subsidy, nuclear is less attractive to industry.

So are all our efforts to become carbon neutral, to put on sandals and a hair shirt and follow the green puritans pointless? Can we go back to business as usual for a while and be happy while it lasts? We could – but not for long. Apart from a lucky break of a natural or a geoengineered kind, in a few decades the Earth could cease to be the habitat of 7 billion humans; it will save itself as it dispatches all but a few of those who now live in what will become the barren regions. Those who leave for the cooler, still fertile regions have a better chance of surviving, and if enough of us are saved this way it could benefit Gaia as well. It seems that enough of us could survive to carry on our species, but there is an overriding need that reduces the carrying capacity of the Earth even further and that is the requirements of Gaia herself. There is much more to survival than human needs alone. To sustain the climate and composition of the Earth, Gaia needs the ecosystems, the forests and other vegetation on land, and the algae of the oceans to sustain life. Otherwise, our planet would move inexorably to the intolerably hot and utterly barren equilibrium state, something that eventually would be an average between Mars and Venus.

The best contradiction of all would be to discover that the idea described by Johannes Lehmann in Nature in 2007 allowed us to take a massive quantity of carbon dioxide from the air by making charcoal and then burying it in the soil. I have described it more fully in Chapter 5 and I do think it has a chance of halting global heating. But having said this, and knowing our obstinate desire to continue with business as usual, I doubt that if it is tried, it will be done to a sufficient extent to realize its promise.

As in war there could be the rapid application of new technology to climate and survival problems. I hope that it will work, but I do not think humans as a species are yet clever enough to handle the coming environmental crisis and I fear they will spend their efforts trying to combat global heating instead of trying to adapt and survive in the new hot world.

I am not claiming that the moderns are unaware of what they do, I am simply saying that what they do - innovate on a large scale in the production of hybrids - is possible only because they steadfastly hold to the absolute dichotomy between the order of Nature and that of Society, a dichotomy which is itself possible only because they never consider the work of purification and that of mediation together. There is no false consciousness involved, since the moderns are explicit about the two tasks. They have to practise the top and the bottom halves of the modern Constitution. The only thing I add is the relation between those two different sets of practices.

So, modernity is not the false consciousness of moderns, and we have to be very careful to grant the Constitution, like the idea of Revolution, WHAT THE CONSTITUTION CLARIFIES AND OBSCURES .. . its own effectiveness. Far from eliminating the work of mediation, it has allowed this work to expand. Just as the idea of Revolution led the revolutionaries to take irreversible decisions that they would not have dared take without it, the Constitution provided the moderns with the daring to mobilize things and people on a scale that they would otherwise have disallowed. This modification of scale was achieved not - as they thought - by the separation of humans and nonhumans but, on the contrary, by the amplification of their contacts. This growth is in turn facilitated by the idea of transcendent Nature (provided that it remains mobilizable), by the idea of free Society (provided that it remains transcendent), and by the absence of all divinity (provided that God speaks to the heart) . So long as their contraries remain simultaneously present and unthinkable, and so long as the work of mediation multiplies hybrids, these three ideas make it possible to capitalize on a large scale. The moderns think they have succeeded in such an expansion only because they have carefully separated Nature and Society (and bracketed God), whereas they have succeeded only because they have mixed together much greater masses of humans and nonhumans, without bracketing anything and without ruling out any combination! The link between the work of purification and the work of mediation has given birth to the moderns, but they credit only the former with their success. In saying this I am not unveiling a practice hidden beneath an official reading, I am simply adding the bottom half to the upper half. They are both necessary together, but as long as we were modern, they simply could not appear as one single and coherent configuration.

Postmodernism is a symptom, not a fresh solution. It lives under the modern Constitution, but it no longer believes in the guarantees the Constitution offers. It senses that something has gone awry in the modern critique, but it is not able to do anything buf prolong that critique, though without believing in its foundations (Lyotard, 1 979). Instead of moving on to empirical studies of the networks that give meaning to the work of purification it denounces, postmodernism rejects all empirical work as illusory and deceptively scientistic (Baudrillard, 1992). Disappointed rationalists, its adepts indeed sense that modernism is done for, but they continue to accept its way of dividing up time; thus they can divide up eras only in terms of successive revolutions. They feel that they come 'after' the moderns, but with the disagreeable sentiment that there is no more 'after'. 'No future': this is the slogan added to the moderns' motto 'No past'. What remains? Disconnected instants and groundless denunciations, since the postmoderns no longer believe in the reasons that would allow them to denounce and to become indignant.

If the critical apparatus of the moderns has made them invincible, why are they hesitating over their own destiny today? If the effectiveness of the Constitution depended precisely upon its obscure half, why can I now relate it to its luminous half? The bond between the two sets of practices must indeed have changed for me to be able to follow both the practices of purification and those of translation. If we can no longer adhere wholeheartedly to the tasks of modernization, unforeseen obstacles must have interfered with the mechanism. What has happened that makes the work of purification unthinkable, when a few years ago it was the deployment of networks that appeared absurd and scandalous? Let us say that the moderns have been victims of their own success. It is a crude explanation, I admit, yet it would appear that the scope of the mobilization of collectives had ended up multiplying hybrids to such an extent that the constitutional framework which both denies and permits their existence could no longer keep them in place. The modern Constitution has collapsed under its own weight, submerged by the mixtures that it tolerated as material for experimentation because it simultaneously dissimulated their impact upon the fabric of society. The third estate ends up being too numerous to feel that it is faithfully represented either by the order of objects or by the order of subjects. When the only thing at stake was the emergence of a few vacuum pumps, they could still be subsumed under two classes, that of natural laws and that of political representations; but when we find ourselves invaded by frozen embryos, expert systems, digital machines, sensorequipped robots, hybrid corn, data banks, psychotropic drugs, whales outfitted with radar sounding devices, gene synthesizers, audience 50 REVOLUTION analyzers, and so on, when our daily newspapers display all these monsters on page after page, and when none of these chimera can be properly on the object side or on the subject side, or even in between, something has to be done. It is as if the two poles of the Constitution had been conflated in the end precisely because of the practice of mediation that this Constitution at once liberates and disavows. It is as if there were no longer enough judges and critics to partition the hybrids. The purification system has become as clogged as our judicial system. Perhaps the modern framework could have held up a little while longer if its very development had not established a short circuit between Nature on the one hand and human masses on the other. So long as Nature was remote and under control, it still vaguely resembled the constitutional pole of tradition, and science could still be seen as a mere intermediary to uncover it. Nature seemed to be held in reserve, transcendent, inexhaustible, distant enough. But where are we to classify the ozone hole story, or global warming or deforestation ? Where are we to put these hybrids? Are they human? Human because they are our work. Are they natural? Natural because they are not our doing. Are they local or global? Both. As for the human masses that have been made to multiply as a result of the virtues and vices of medicine and economics, they are no easier to situate. In what world are these multitudes to be housed? Are we in the realm of biology, sociology, natural history, ethics, sociobiology? This is our own doing, yet the laws of demography and economics are infinitely beyond us. Is the demographic time bomb local or global? Both. Thus, the two constitutional guarantees of the moderns - the universal laws of things, and the inalienable rights of subjects - can no longer be recognized either on the side of Nature or on the side of the Social. The destiny of the starving multitudes and the fate of our poor planet are connected by the same Gordian knot that no Alexander will ever again manage to sever.

Austin articulated his theory of ‘performative speech acts’, which he defined as utterances that perform an action, as opposed to just describing or reporting it. In much of linguistics and the philosophy of language, the general understanding had been that language was a way of making factual assertions, of describing reality. Austin and his followers, such as John Searle, direct us to pay attention to the kinds of work language does in everyday activities: how it creates reality through the production of meaning, rather than simply reflecting a pre-existing meaning itself. do it was a development of this research.

Jonathan Rée playfully acknowledges this fact when he writes that “twentieth-century approaches to subjectivity are dominated by the anxiety not to be Descartes” (206). This characterization certainly rings true as we consider how understandings of subjectivity evolved from a stable (Cartesian) self in the Victorian era, to a conflicted ego in the work of Freud, to a fragmented personality after World War II, to a linguistic construct in the latter decades of the twentieth century. This is, of course, only the broadest of outlines, and one that obviously ignores the nuances and complexities of how ideas about the subject cut across various contexts and disciplines, but it captures the basic “structure of feeling,” to borrow a phrase from Raymond Williams. However, as our argument must rest on something more solid than a structure of feeling, I would like to take a moment to explain why this book reduces this timeline even further by employing the terms modernism and postmodernism before describing its particular framing of subjectivity and explaining why it suits this project.

To become a social scientist is to realize that the inner properties of objects do not count, that they are mere receptacles for human categories. The difficulty, however, is to reconcile this form of denunciation with another one in which the directions of the arrows are exactly reversed. Ordinary people, mere social actors, average citizens, believe that they are free and that they can modify their desires, their motives and their rational strategies at will. The arrow of their beliefs now goes from the Subject/Society pole to the Nature pole. But fortunately, social scientists WHAT IS A QUASI-OBJECT? 53 are standing guard, and they denounce, and debunk and ridicule this naive belief in the freedom of the human subject and society. This time they use the nature of things - that is the indisputable results of the sciences - to show how it determines, informs and moulds the soft and pliable wills of the poor humans.

Society is either too powerful or too weak vis-a-vis objects which are alternatively too powerful or too arbitrary. The solution to this double contradictory denunciation is so pervasive that it has been providing social scientists with most of their common sense; it is called dualism. The Nature pole will be partitioned into two sets: the first list will incude its 'softer' parts - screens for projecting social categories - while the second list will include all its 'harder' parts - causes for determining the fate of human categories: that is, the sciences and the technologies. The same partition will be made on the Subject/ Society pole: there will be its 'harder' components - the sui generis social factors - and its 'softer' components - determined by the forces discovered by sciences and technologies. Social scientists will happily alternate from one to the other showing without any trouble that for instance gods are mere idols shaped by the requirements of social order, while the rules of society are determined by biology.

Society had to produce everything arbitrarily including the cosmic order, biology, chemistry, and the laws of physics! The implausibility of this claim was so blatant for the 'hard' parts of nature that we suddenly realized how implausible it was for the 'soft' ones as well. Objects are not the shapeless receptacles of social categories - neither the 'hard' ones nor the 'soft' ones.

How have the major philosophies attempted to absorb both the modern Constitution and the quasi-objects, that Middle Kingdom which kept on expanding? By simplifying considerably, we can identify three principal strategies. The first consists in establishing a great gap between objects 56 REVOLUTION and subjects and continually increasing the distance between them; the second, known as the 'semiotic turn', focuses on the middle and abandons the extremes; the third isolates the idea of Being, thus rejecting the whole divide between objects, discourse and subjects. Let me undertake a rapid survey of the first group. The more quasiobjects multiply, the more the major philosophies treat the two constitutional poles as incommensurable, even while they assert that there is no task more urgent than their reconciliation. So these philosophies illustrate the modern paradox in their own fashion by forbidding what they allow and allowing what they forbid. Each of these philosophies is, of course, infinitely more subtle than my inadequate summary; each one is by definition nonmodern since modernism has never really begun; thus each explicitly addresses the same problem I am awkwardly attempting to address; but their official and popularized interpretations nevertheless attest, on this point, to an astonishing consistency in the way they define their task: how to multiply quasiobjects without accepting them, in order to maintain the Great Divide that separates us both from our past and from other nature-cultures.

longer absorb. Once again the modern paradox is taken further. The notion of intentionality transforms a distinction, a separation, a contradiction, into an insurmountable tension between object and subject. The hopes of dialectics are abandoned, since this tension offers no resolution. The phenomenologists have the impression that they have gone further than Kant and Hegel and Marx, since they no longer attribute any essence either to pure subjects or to pure objects. They really have the impression that they are speaking only of a mediation that does not require any pole to hold fast. Yet like so many anxious modernizers, they no longer trace anything but a line between poles that are thus given the greatest importance. Pure objectivity and pure consciousness are missing, but they are nevertheless - indeed, all the more - in place. The 'consciousness of something' becomes nothing more than a slender footbridge spanning a gradually widening abyss. Phenomenologists had to cave in - and they did. During the same period, Gaston Bachelard's dual enterprise - which further exaggerates the objectivity of the sciences by dint of breaking with common sense, and symmetrically exaggerates the objectless power of the imaginary by dint THE END OF ENDS 59 of epistemological breaks - offers the perfect symbol for this impossible crisis, this drawing and quartering (Bachelard, 1967; Tile, 1984).

Otherness represents the fundamental category of immunology. Every immunoreaction is a reaction to Otherness. Now, however, Otherness is being replaced with difference, which does not entail immunoreaction. Postimmunological—indeed, postmodern—difference does not make anyone sick. In terms of immunology, it represents the Same.2 Such difference lacks the sting of foreignness, as it were, which would provoke a strong immunoreaction. Foreignness itself is being deactivated into a formula of consumption. The alien is giving way to the exotic. The tourist travels through it. The tourist—that is, the consumer—is no longer an immunological subject.

I may be mistaken, but the present day writer, when he takes his pen in hand to treat a subject which he has studied deeply, has to bear in mind that the average reader, who has never concerned himself with this subject, if he reads does so with the view, not of learning something from the writer, but rather, of pronouncing judgment on him when he is not in agreement with the commonplaces that the said reader carries in his head. If the individuals who make up the mass believed themselves specially qualified, it would be a case merely of personal error, not a sociological subversion.

We are living in a leveling period; there is a leveling of fortunes, of culture among the various social classes, of the sexes. Well, in the same way there is a leveling of continents, and as the European was formerly lower from a vital point of view, he has come out the gainer from this leveling. Consequently, from this standpoint, the uprising of the masses implies a fabulous increase of vital possibilities, quite the contrary of what we hear so often about the decadence of Europe. This is a confused and clumsy expression, in which it is not clear what is being referred to, whether it is the European states, or European culture, or what lies underneath all this, and is of infinitely greater importance, the vital activity of Europe.

There have been, then, various periods in history which have felt themselves as having attained a full, definitive height, periods in which it is thought that the end of a journey has been reached, a long-felt desire obtained, a hope completely fulfilled. This is “the plenitude of the time,” the full ripening of historic life. And, in fact, thirty years ago, the European believed that human life had come to be what it ought to be, what for generations previous it had been desiring to be, what it was henceforward always bound to be. These epochs of plenitude always regard themselves as the result of many other preparatory periods, of other times lacking in plenitude, inferior to their own, above which this time of full-flower has risen. Seen from this height, those preparatory periods give the impression that during them life was an affair of mere longing and illusion unrealized, of unsatisfied desire, of eager precursors, a time of “not yet,” of painful contrast between the definite aspiration and the reality which does not correspond to it. Thus the XIX Century looks upon the Middle Ages. At length, the day arrives on which that old, sometimes age-long, desire seems to be fully attained, reality accepts it and submits to it. We have arrived at the heights we had in view, the goal to which we had looked forward, the summit of time. To “not yet” has succeeded “at last.”

The desires so long in conception, which the XIX Century seems at last to realize, is what it named for itself in a word as “modern culture.” The very name is a disturbing one; this time calls itself “modern,” that is to say, final, definitive, in whose presence all the rest is mere preterite, humble preparation and aspiration towards this present.

I shall consider certain of these some other time; for the moment I wish to advance the most obvious one. It arises from the fact that, faithful to an ideology which I consider a thing of the past, only the political or cultural aspects of history are considered, and it is not realized that these are the mere surface of history; that in preference to, and deeper than, these, the reality of history lies in biological power, in pure vitality, in what there is in man of cosmic energy, not identical with, but related to, the energy which agitates the sea, fecundates the beast, causes the tree to flower and the star to shine.

Physical space and time are the absolutely stupid aspects of the universe. Hence, there is more reason than is generally allowed in that worship of mere speed which is at present being indulged in by our contemporaries. Speed, which is made up of space and time, is no less stupid than its constituents, but it serves to nullify them. One stupidity can only be overcome by another. It was a question of honor for man to triumph over cosmic space and time (7), which are entirely devoid of meaning, and there is no reason for surprise at the fact that we get a childish pleasure out of the indulgence in mere speed, by means of which we kill space and strangle time. By annulling them, we give them life, we make them serve vital purposes, we can be in more places than we could before, enjoy more comings and goings, consume more cosmic time in less vital time. But after all, the really important increase of our world does not lie in its greater dimensions, but in its containing many more things. Each of these things – the word is to be taken in its widest acceptation – is something which we can desire, attempt, do, undo, meet with, enjoy or repel; all notions which imply vital activities. Take any one of our ordinary activities; buying, for example. Imagine two men, one of the present day and one of the XVIII Century, possessed of equal fortunes relatively to money-values in their respective periods, and compare the stock of purchasable things offered to each. The difference is almost fabulous.

To live is to feel ourselves fatally obliged to exercise our liberty, to decide what we are going to be in this world. Not for a single moment is our activity of decision allowed to rest. Even when in desperation we abandon ourselves to whatever may happen, we have decided not to decide. It is, then, false to say that in life “circumstances decide”. On the contrary, circumstances are the dilemma, constantly renewed, in presence of which we have to make our decision; what actually decides is our character. All this is equally valid for collective life.

from day to day. The phenomenon is an extraordinarily strange one. Public authority is in the hands of a representative of the masses. These are so powerful that they have wiped out all opposition. They are in possession of power in such an unassailable manner that it would be difficult to find in history examples of a Government so all-powerful as these are. And yet public authority – the Government – exists from hand to mouth, it does not offer itself as a frank solution for the future, it represents no clear announcement of the future, it does not stand out as the beginning of something whose development or evolution is conceivable. In short, it lives without any vital programme, any plan of existence. It does not know where it is going, because, strictly speaking, it has no fixed road, no predetermined trajectory before it. When such a public authority attempts to justify itself it makes no reference at all to the future. On the contrary, it shuts itself up in the present, and says with perfect sincerity: “I am an abnormal form of Government imposed by circumstances”. Hence its activities are reduced to dodging the difficulties of the hour; not solving them, but escaping from them for the time being, employing any methods whatsoever, even at the cost of accumulating thereby still greater difficulties for the hour which follows. Such has public power always been when exercised directly by the masses: omnipotent and ephemeral. The mass-man is he whose life lacks any purpose, and simply goes drifting along. Consequently, though his possibilities and his powers be enormous, he constructs nothing. And it is this type of man who decides in our time. It will be well, then, that we analyze his character.

The fact is this: from the time European history begins in the VI Century up to the year 1800 – that is, through the course of twelve centuries – Europe does not succeed in reaching a total population greater than 180 million inhabitants. Now, from 1800 to 1914-little more than a century-the population of Europe mounts from 180 to 460 millions! I take it that the contrast between these figures leaves no doubt as to the prolific qualities of the last century. In three generations it produces a gigantic mass of humanity which, launched like a torrent over the historic area, has inundated it. This fact, I repeat, should suffice to make us realize the triumph of the masses and all that is implied and announced by it. Furthermore, it should be added as the most concrete item to that rising of the level of existence which I have already indicated. But at the same time this fact proves to us how unfounded is our admiration when we lay stress on the increase of new countries like the United States of America. We are astonished at this increase, which has reached to 100 millions in a century, when the really astonishing fact is the teeming fertility of Europe. Here we have another reason for correcting the deceptive notion of the Americanization of Europe. Not even that characteristic which might seem specifically American – the rapidity of increase in population – is peculiarly such. Europe has increased in the last century much more than America. America has been formed from the overflow of Europe.

In the figures cited, then, it is not the increase of population which interests me, but the fact that by the contrast with the previous figures the dizzy rapidity of the increase is brought into relief. This is the point of importance for us at the moment. For that rapidity means that heap after heap of human beings have been dumped on to the historic scene at such an accelerated rate, that it has been difficult to saturate them with traditional culture. And in fact, the average type of European at present possesses a soul, healthier and stronger it is true than those of the last century, but much more simple. Hence, at times he leaves the impression of a primitive man suddenly risen in the midst of a very old civilization. In the schools, which were such a source of pride to the last century, it has been impossible to do more than instruct the masses in the technique of modern life; it has been found impossible to educate them. They have been given tools for an intenser form of existence, but no feeling for their great historic duties; they have been hurriedly inoculated with the pride and power of modern instruments, but not with their spirit. Hence they will have nothing to do with their spirit, and the new generations are getting ready to take over command of the world as if the world were a paradise without trace of former footsteps, without traditional and highly complex problems.

Hence there is no exaggeration in saying that the man who is the product of the XIX Century is, for the effects of public life, a man apart from all other men. The XVIII Century man differs, of course, from the XVII Century man, and this one in turn from his fellow of the XVI Century, but they are all related, similar, even identical in essentials when confronted with this new man. For the “common” man of all periods “life” had principally meant limitation, obligation, dependence; in a word, pressure. Say oppression, if you like, provided it be understood not only in the juridical and social sense, but also in the cosmic. For it is this latter which has never been lacking up to a hundred years ago, the date at which starts the practically limitless expansion of scientific technique – physical and administrative. Previously, even for the rich and powerful, the world was a place of poverty, difficulty and danger (15).

The world which surrounds the new man from his birth does not compel him to limit himself in any fashion, it sets up no veto in opposition to him; on the contrary, it incites his appetite, which in principle can increase indefinitely. Now it turns out – and this is most important – that this world of the XIX and early XX Centuries not only has the perfections and the completeness which it actually possesses, but furthermore suggests to those who dwell in it the radical assurance that tomorrow it will be still richer, ampler, more perfect, as if it enjoyed a spontaneous, inexhaustible power of increase. Even today, in spite of some signs which are making a tiny breach in that sturdy faith, even today, there are few men who doubt that motorcars will in five years’ time be more comfortable and cheaper than to-day.

They believe in this as they believe that the sun will rise in the morning. The metaphor is an exact one. For, in fact, the common man, finding himself in a world so excellent, technically and socially, believes that it has been produced by nature, and never thinks of the personal efforts of highly-endowed individuals which the creation of this new world presupposed. Still less will he admit the notion that all these facilities still require the support of certain difficult human virtues, the least failure of which would cause the rapid disappearance of the whole magnificent edifice.

There is no question concerning public life, in which he does not intervene, blind and deaf as he is, imposing his “opinions”.

It is no use speaking of ideas when there is no acceptance of a higher authority to regulate them, a series of standards to which it is possible to appeal in a discussion. These standards are the principles on which culture rests. I am not concerned with the form they take. What I affirm is that there is no culture where there are no standards to which our fellow-men can have recourse. There is no culture where there are no principles of legality to which to appeal. There is no culture where there is no acceptance of certain final intellectual positions to which a dispute may be referred (23). There is no culture where economic relations are not subject to a regulating principle to protect interests involved. There is no culture where aesthetic controversy does not recognize the necessity of justifying the work of art. When all these things are lacking there is no culture; there is in the strictest sense of the word, barbarism. And let us not deceive ourselves, this is what is beginning to appear in Europe under the progressive rebellion of the masses. The traveller who arrives in a barbarous country knows that in that territory there are no ruling principles to which it is possible to appeal. Properly speaking, there are no barbarian standards. Barbarism is the absence of standards to which appeal can be made.

The average man finds himself with “ideas” in his head, but he lacks the faculty of ideation. He has no conception even of the rare atmosphere in which ideas live. He wishes to have opinions, but is unwilling to accept the conditions and presuppositions that underlie all opinion. Hence his ideas are in effect nothing more than appetites in words, something like musical romanzas.

Advanced civilization is one and the same thing as arduous problems. Hence, the greater the progress, the greater danger it is in. Life gets gradually better, but evidently also gradually more complicated. Of course, as problems become more complex, the means of solving them also become more perfect. But each new generation must master these perfected means. Amongst them – to come to the concrete – there is one most plainly attached to the advance of a civilization, namely, that it have a great deal of the past at its back, a great deal of experience; in a word: history.

To these venerable commonplaces might be added other truths less well known, though no less probable, amongst them this one: a revolution does not last more than fifteen years, the period which coincides with the flourishing of a generation (33). Whoever aspires to create a new social or political reality must before all concern himself to ensure that these humble commonplaces of historical experience will be invalidated by the situation which he brings into being. For my part, I shall reserve the title of “man of genius” for the politician who has hardly begun his operations when the professors of history in our colleges begin to go mad, as they see all the “laws” of their science interrupted in their action, falling to pieces, reduced to dust.

The spoiled child is the heir who behaves exclusively as a mere heir. In this case the inheritance is civilization – with its conveniences, its security; in a word, with all its advantages. As we have seen, it is only in circumstances of easy existence such as our civilization has produced, that a type can arise, marked by such a collection of features, inspired by such a character. It is one of a number of deformities produced by luxury in human material. There might be a deceptive tendency to believe that a life born into a world of plenty should be better, more really a life than one which consists in a struggle against scarcity. Such is not the case, for reasons of the strictest and most fundamental nature, which this is not the place to enlarge upon. For the present, instead of those reasons, it is sufficient to recall the ever-recurrent fact which constitutes the tragedy of every hereditary aristocracy. The aristocrat inherits, that is to say, he finds attributed to his person, conditions of life which he has not created, and which, therefore, are not produced in organic union with his personal, individual existence. At birth he finds himself installed, suddenly and without knowing how, in the midst of his riches and his prerogatives. In his own self, he has nothing to do with them, because they do not come from him. They are the giant armor of some other person, some other human being, his ancestor. And he has to live as an heir, that is to say, he has to wear the trappings of another existence. What does this bring us to? What life is the “aristocrat” by inheritance going to lead, his own or that of his first noble ancestor? Neither one nor the other. He is condemned to represent the other man, consequently to be neither that other nor himself. Inevitably his life loses all authenticity, and is transformed into pure representation or fiction of another life. The abundance of resources that he is obliged to make use of gives him no chance to live out his own personal destiny, his life is atrophied. All life is the struggle, the effort to be itself. The difficulties which I meet with in order to realize my existence are precisely what awakens and mobilizes my activities, my capacities. If my body was not a weight to me, I should not be able to walk. If the atmosphere did not press on me, I should feel my body as something vague, flabby, unsubstantial. So in the “aristocratic” heir his whole individuality grows vague, for lack of use and vital effort. The result is that specific stupidity of “our old nobility” which is unlike anything else – a stupidity which, strictly speaking, has never yet been described in its intimate, tragic mechanism – that tragic mechanism which leads all hereditary aristocracy to irremediable degeneration.

One may formulate, as follows, a law confirmed by paleontology and biogeography: human life has arisen and progressed only when the resources it could count on were balanced by the problems it met with. This is true, as much in the spiritual order as in the physical. Thus, to refer to a very concrete aspect of corporal existence, I may recall that the human species has flourished in zones of our planet where the hot season is compensated by a season of intense cold. In the tropics the animal-man degenerates, and vice versa, inferior races – the pygmies, for example – have been pushed back towards the tropics by races born after them and superior in the scale of evolution.

This is the epoch of “currents” and of “letting things slide.” Hardly anyone offers any resistance to the superficial whirlwinds that arise in art, in ideas, in politics, or in social usages. Consequently, rhetoric flourishes more than ever. The surrealist thinks he has outstripped the whole of literary history when he has written (here a word that there is no need to write) where others have written “jasmines, swans and fauns.” But what he has really done has been simply to bring to light another form of rhetoric which hitherto lay hidden in the latrines.

When by 1890 a third generation assumes intellectual command in Europe we meet with a type of scientist unparalleled in history. He is one who, out of all that has to be known in order to be a man of judgment, is only acquainted with one science, and even of that one only knows the small corner in which he is an active investigator. He even proclaims it as a virtue that he takes no cognisance of what lies outside the narrow territory specially cultivated by himself, and gives the name of “dilettantism” to any curiosity for the general scheme of knowledge. What happens is that, enclosed within the narrow limits of his visual field, he does actually succeed in discovering new facts and advancing the progress of the science which he hardly knows, and incidentally the encyclopedia of thought of which he is conscientiously ignorant. How has such a thing been possible, how is it still possible? For it is necessary to insist upon this extraordinary but undeniable fact: experimental science has progressed thanks in great part to the work of men astoundingly mediocre, and even less than mediocre. That is to say, modern science, the root and symbol of our actual civilization, finds a place for-the intellectually commonplace man and allows him to work therein with success. The reason of this lies in what is at the same time the great advantage and the gravest peril of the new science, and of the civilization directed and represented by it, namely, mechanization.

But if the specialist is ignorant of the inner philosophy of the science he cultivates, he is much more radically ignorant of the historical conditions requisite for its continuation; that is to say: how society and the heart of man are to be organized in order that there may continue to be investigators. The decrease in scientific vocations noted in recent years, to which I have alluded, is an anxious symptom for anyone who has a clear idea of what civilization is, an idea generally lacking to the typical “scientist”, the high-point of our present civilization. He also believes that civilization is there in just the same way as the earth’s crust and the forest primeval.

Since 1848, that is to say, since the beginning of the second generation of bourgeois governments, there have been no genuine revolutions in Europe. Not assuredly because there were no motives for them, but because there were no means. Public power was brought to the level of social power. Goodbye for ever to Revolutions! The only thing now possible in Europe is their opposite: the coup d’etat. Everything which in following years tried to look like a revolution was only a coup d’etat in disguise.

The first State or public authority formed in Europe is the Church, with its specific, well-defined character of “the spiritual power.” From the Church the political power learns that it, too, in its origin, is a spiritual authority, the prevalence of certain ideas, and there is created the Holy Roman Empire. Thus arises the struggle between two powers, which, having no differentiation in substance (as they are both spirit), reach an agreement by which each limits itself to a time-category; the temporal and the eternal. Temporal power and religious power are equally spiritual, but the one is the spirit of time, public opinion, mundane and fluctuating, whilst the other is the spirit of eternity, the opinion of God, God’s view of man and his destiny. It comes to the same thing then to say: At a given period, such a man, such a people, or such a homogeneous group of peoples, are in command, as to say: At this given period there predominates in the world such a system of opinions – ideas, preferences, aspirations, purposes.

How is this predominance to be understood? The majority of men have no opinions, and these have to be pumped into them from outside, like lubricants into machinery. Hence it is necessary that some mind or other should hold and exercise authority, so that the people without opinions – the majority – can start having opinions. For without these, the common life of humanity would be chaos, a historic void, lacking in any organic structure. Consequently, without a spiritual power, without someone to command, and in proportion as this is lacking, chaos reigns over mankind. And similarly, all displacement of power, every change of authority, implies a change of opinions, and therefore nothing less than a change of historical gravitation. Let us go back again to where we started from. For several centuries the world has been ruled by Europe, a conglomerate of peoples akin in spirit. In the Middle Ages there was no such rule in temporal matters. So it has happened in all the middle ages of history. That is why they represent a relative chaos, relative barbarism, a deficit of public opinion. They are times in which men love, hate, desire, detest; all this without limit; but, on the other hand, there is no opinion. Such epochs are not without their charm. But in the great epochs, what mankind lives by is opinion, and therefore, order rules. On the further side of the Middle Ages we also find a period in which, as in the Modern Age, there is someone in command, though only over a limited portion of the world: Rome, the great director. It was she who set up order in the Mediterranean and its borders.

Today it is one thing, tomorrow another, opposite to the first. Life is lost at finding itself all alone. Mere egoism is a labyrinth. This is quite understandable. Really to live is to be directed towards something, to progress towards a goal. The goal is not my motion, not my life, it is the something to which I put my life and which consequently is outside it, beyond it. If I decide to walk alone inside my own existence, egoistically, I make no progress. I arrive nowhere.

The city is not built, as is the cottage or the domus, to shelter from the weather and to propagate the species – these are personal, family concerns – but in order to discuss public affairs. Observe that this signifies nothing less than the invention of a new kind of space, much more new than the space of Einstein. Till then only one space existed, that of the open country, with all the consequences that this involves for the existence of man. The man of the fields is still a sort of vegetable. His existence, all that he feels, thinks, wishes for, preserves the listless drowsiness in which the plant lives. The great civilizations of Asia and Africa were, from this point of view, huge anthropomorphic vegetations. But the Graeco-Roman decides to separate himself from the fields, from “Nature,” from the geo-botanic cosmos. How is this possible? How can man withdraw himself from the fields? Where will he go, since the earth is one huge, unbounded field? Quite simple; he will mark off a portion of this field by means of walls, which set up an enclosed, finite space over against amorphous, limitless space. Here you have the public square. It is not, like the house, an “interior” shut in from above, as are the caves which exist in the fields, it is purely and simply the negation of the fields. The square, thanks to the walls which enclose it, is a portion of the countryside which turns its back on the rest, eliminates the rest and sets up in opposition to it. This lesser, rebellious field, which secedes from the limitless one, and keeps to itself, is a space sui generis, of the most novel kind, in which man frees himself from the community of the plant and the animal, leaves them outside, and creates an enclosure apart which is purely human, a civil space. Hence Socrates, the great townsman, quintessence of the spirit of the polis, can say: “I have nothing to do with the trees of the field, I have to do only with the man of the city.” What has ever been known of this by the Hindu, the Persian, the Chinese, or the Egyptian? Up to the time of Alexander and of Caesar, respectively, the history of Greece and of Rome consists of an incessant struggle between these two spaces: between the rational city and the vegetable country, between the lawgiver and the husbandman, between jus and rus.

Before all, the State is a plan of action and a programme of collaboration. The men are called upon so that together they may do something. The State is neither consanguinity, nor linguistic unity, nor territorial unity, nor proximity of habitation. It is nothing material, inert, fixed, limited. It is pure dynamism – the will to do something in common – and thanks to this the idea of the State is bounded by no physical limits.

A similar misconception arises when an attempt is made to base the idea of a nation on a territorial shape, finding the principle of unity which blood and language do not furnish, in the geographical mysticism of “natural frontiers.” We are faced with the same optical illusion. The hazard of actual circumstances shows us so-called nations installed in wide lands on the continent or adjacent islands. It is thought to make of those actual boundaries something permanent and spiritual. They are, we are told, natural frontiers, and by their “naturalness” is implied some sort of magic predetermination of history by terrestrial form. But this myth immediately disappears when submitted to the same reasoning which invalidated community of blood and language as originators of the nation. Here again, if we go back a few centuries, we find France and Spain dissociated in lesser nations, with their inevitable “natural frontiers.” The mountain frontier may be less imposing than the Pyrenees or the Alps, the barrier of water less considerable than the Rhine, the English Channel, or the Straits of Gibraltar. But this only proves that the “naturalness” of the frontiers is merely relative. It depends on the economic and warlike resources of the period.
